= Building an app with JHipster

When I started writing this book, I had a few different ideas for a sample application. My first idea involved creating a photo gallery to showcase the 1966 VW Bus I've been working on since 2006. The project was recently finished and I wanted a website to show how things have progressed through the years.

ifeval::["{media}" == "screen"]
I also thought about creating a blog application. As part of http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/getting_hip_with_jhipster_at[my first presentation on JHipster] (at the http://www.denverjug.org/[Denver Java Users Group]), I created a blog application that I live-coded in front of the audience. After that presentation, I spent several hours polishing the application and started http://www.jhipster-book.com[The JHipster Mini-Book site] with it.

After thinking about the VW Bus Gallery and developing the blog application, I thought to myself, is this hip enough? Shouldn't a book about becoming what the JHipster homepage calls a "`Java Hipster`" show how to build a hip application?

I wrote to Julien Dubois, founder of JHipster, and Dennis Sharpe, the technical editor for this book, and asked them what they thought. We went back and forth on a few ideas: a https://gitter.im[Gitter] clone, a job board for JHipster coders, a shopping-cart app. Then it hit me: there was an idea I'd been wanting to develop for a while.

It's basically an app that you can use to monitor your health. In late September through mid-October 2014, I'd done a sugar detox during which I stopped eating sugar, started exercising regularly, and stopped drinking alcohol. I'd had high blood pressure for over 10 years and was on blood-pressure medication at the time. During the first week of the detox, I ran out of blood-pressure medication. Since a new prescription required a doctor visit, I decided I'd wait until after the detox to get it. After three weeks, not only did I lose 15 pounds, but my blood pressure was at normal levels!

Before I started the detox, I came up with a 21-point system to see how healthy I was being each week. Its rules were simple: you can earn up to three points per day for the following reasons:

1. If you eat healthy, you get a point. Otherwise, zero.
2. If you exercise, you get a point.
3. If you don't drink alcohol, you get a point.

I was surprised to find I got eight points the first week I used this system. During the detox, I got 16 points the first week, 20 the second, and 21 the third. Before the detox, I thought eating healthy meant eating anything except fast food. After the detox, I realized that eating healthy for me meant eating no sugar. I'm also a big lover of craft beer, so I modified the alcohol rule to allow two healthier alcohol drinks (like a greyhound or red wine) per day.

My goal is to earn 15 points per week. I find that if I get more, I'll likely lose weight and have good blood pressure. If I get fewer than 15, I risk getting sick. I've been tracking my health like this since September 2014. I've lost 30 pounds and my blood pressure has returned to and maintained normal levels. I haven't had good blood pressure since my early 20s, so this has been a life changer for me.

I thought writing a "`21-Point Health`" application would work because tracking your health is always important. Wearables that can track your health stats might be able to use the APIs or hooks I create to record points for a day. Imagine hooking into http://dailymile.com[dailymile] (where I track my exercise) or https://untappd.com[Untappd] (where I sometimes list the beers I drink). Or even displaying other activities for a day (e.g. showing your blood-pressure score that you keep on http://www.apple.com/ios/health/[iOS Health]).

I thought my idea would fit nicely with JHipster and Spring Boot from a monitoring standpoint. Spring Boot has lots of health monitors for apps, and now you can use this JHipster app to monitor your health!

== Creating the application

I started using the https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[Installing JHipster] instructions. I'm a Java developer, so I already had Java 11 installed, as well as Maven and Git. I installed Node.js 16 from https://nodejs.org/[Nodejs.org], then ran the following command to install JHipster.

[source]
----
npm install -g generator-jhipster@7
----

TIP: If you need to install Java, Maven, or Git, please see https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[JHipster's local installation documentation].

Then I proceeded to build my application. Unlike many application generators in Javaland, Yeoman expects you to be in the directory you want to create your project in, rather than creating the directory for you. So I created a `21-points` directory and typed the following command in it to invoke JHipster.

[source]
----
jhipster
----

ifeval::["{media}" != "prepress"]
After running this command, I was prompted to answer questions about how I wanted my application to be generated. You can see the choices I made in the following screenshot.

You can see that I chose H2 with disk-based persistence for development and PostgreSQL for my production database. I did this because using a non-embedded database offers some important benefits:

* Your data is retained when restarting the application.
* Your application starts a bit faster.
* You can use Liquibase to generate a database changelog.

The http://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] homepage describes it as source control for your database. It will help create new fields as you add them to your entities. It will also refactor your database, for example creating tables and dropping columns. It also has the ability to undo changes to your database, either automatically or with custom SQL.

After answering all the questions, JHipster created a whole bunch of files, then ran `npm install`. To prove everything was good to go, I ran the Java unit tests using `./gradlew test`.

JHipster 5+ will only work with an external Elasticsearch instance. In previous versions, you could use an embedded Elasticsearch instance, but Elasticsearch has removed this ability in recent releases. The easiest way to run a local Elasticsearch instance is to use Docker Compose. I ran the following command to start Elasticsearch as a daemon. Remove the `-d` option if you don't want it to run as a daemon.

----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/elasticsearch.yml up -d
----

Next, I started the app using `./gradlew` and then ran the UI integration tests in another terminal with `npm run e2e`. All tests passed with flying colors.

----

To prove the `prod` profile worked and I could talk to PostgreSQL, I ran Docker Compose for PostgreSQL.

Then I restarted the app with the `prod` profile enabled.

.Using a local PostgreSQL database
--
[.text-left]
You can also use a local PostgreSQL database. To do this on a Mac, I installed http://postgresapp.com/[Postgres.app]. I shut down the Docker image running PostgreSQL.

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
----

Then, I tried creating a local PostgreSQL database with settings from `src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml`.

----
psql (14.5)
Type "help" for help.

template1=# create user TwentyOnePoints with password '21points';
CREATE ROLE
template1=# create database TwentyOnePoints;
CREATE DATABASE
template1=# grant all privileges on database TwentyOnePoints to TwentyOnePoints;
GRANT
template1=# \q
----

I updated `application-prod.yml` to use `21points` for the datasource password.

I confirmed I could talk to a PostgreSQL database when running with the `prod` profile. I was greeted with an error saying that things were not set up correctly.

[source%autofit]
----
$ ./gradlew -Pprod
...
2022-09-12T09:23:39.948-07:00 ERROR 91406 --- [           main] com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.HikariPool        : Hikari - Exception during pool initialization.

org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: role "TwentyOnePoints" does not exist
----

I quickly realized that PostgreSQL is case-insensitive, so even though I typed "TwentyOnePoints", it configured the database name and username as "twentyonepoints". I updated `application-prod.yml` with the correct case and tried again. This time it worked!
--

=== Adding source control

One of the first things I like to do when creating a new project is to add it to a version-control system (VCS). In this particular case, I chose Git and GitHub.

JHipster will initialize Git for your project automatically if you have Git installed. The following commands show how I added a reference to the remote GitHub repository, then pushed everything. I created the repository on GitHub before executing these commands.

[source]
----
git remote add origin git@github.com:mraible/21-points.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
----

The response should indicate success:

----

 * [new branch]      main -> main

----

This is how I created a new application with JHipster and checked it into source control. If you're creating an application following similar steps, I believe there are two common approaches for continuing. The first involves developing the application, then testing and deploying. The second option is to set up continuous integration, deploy, then begin development and testing. In a team development environment, I recommend the second option. However, since you're likely reading this as an individual, I'll follow the first approach and get right to coding. If you're interested in setting up continuous integration with Jenkins, please see https://www.jhipster.tech/setting-up-ci-jenkins2/[Setting up Continuous Integration on Jenkins 2].

== Building the UI and business logic

ifeval::["{media}" == "screen"]
I wanted 21-Points Health to be a bit more hip than a stock JHipster application. Bootstrap was all the rage several years ago, but now Google's https://material.io/[Material Design] is growing in popularity. I searched for "material" in the https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/marketplace/[JHipster Marketplace] and found the https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/marketplace/#/details/generator-jhipster-bootstrap-material-design[Bootstrap Material Design] module. Unfortunately, I soon found out it doesn't support JHipster 4+.

In v4 of this book (and 21-Points Health), I opted to use Bootstrap and its default theme; changing some variables so it looked like Angular Material. Since I got used to it, I decided to keep this same setup for this version. To make the default Bootstrap theme look like Material Design, modify `_bootstrap-variables.scss` and replace it with the contents below.

[source,sass]

 */

// Colors:
// Grayscale and brand colors for use across Bootstrap.

$border-radius: 0.15rem;
$border-radius-lg: 0.125rem;
$border-radius-sm: 0.1rem;

$headings-font-weight: 300;

$link-color: $primary;

$input-focus-border-color: lighten($blue, 25%);

Then add the following Sass to the bottom of `global.scss`.

+
[source,sass]
----
// Import Bootstrap source files from node_modules
// @import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
----
+
. Add the following to import the MDB stylesheet in `src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss`:
+
[source%autofit,sass]
----
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap');
@import '~mdb-angular-ui-kit/assets/scss/mdb.scss';

. Add `https://fonts.googleapis.com` and `https://fonts.gstatic.com` to the `style-src` and `font-src` content security policy rules in `src/main/resources/config/application.yml`.
+
[source,yaml]
----

[source,sass]
----
/* Error highlight on input fields */
.ng-valid[required],
.ng-valid.required {
  border-left: 5px solid green;
}

.ng-invalid:not(form) {
  border-left: 5px solid red;
}
----
+
. Modify the `.dropdown-menu` rule to set the display to `none`.

At this point, I deployed to Heroku for the first time. This is covered in the <<Deploying to Heroku>> section of this chapter.

=== Generating entities

For each entity you want to create, you will need:

* a database table;
* a Liquibase change set;
* a JPA entity class;
* a Spring Data `JpaRepository` interface;
* a Spring MVC `RestController` class;
* an Angular router, controller, and service; and
* a HTML page.

In addition, you should have integration tests to verify that everything works and performance tests to verify that it runs fast. In an ideal world, you'd also have unit tests and integration tests for your Angular code.

The good news is JHipster can generate all of this code for you, including integration tests, and performance tests. In addition, if you have entities with relationships, it will generate the necessary schema to support them (with foreign keys), and the TypeScript and HTML code to manage them. You can also set up validation to require certain fields as well as control their length.

JHipster supports several methods of code generation. The first uses its https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-entity/[entity sub-generator]. The entity sub-generator is a command-line tool that prompts you with questions to answer. https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/[JDL-Studio] is a browser-based tool for defining your domain model with JHipster Domain Language (JDL). Finally, https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-uml/[JHipster-UML] is an option for those that like UML. Supported UML editors include https://www.modeliosoft.com/[Modelio], http://www.umldesigner.org/[UML Designer], and https://www.genmymodel.com/[GenMyModel]. Because the entity sub-generator is one of the simplest to use, I chose that for this project.

TIP: If you want to see how easy it is to use JDL-Studio, please see my https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lf64CctDAQ[Get Started with JHipster 7 Screencast].

At this point, I did some trial-and-error designs with the data model. I generated entities with JHipster, tried the app, and changed to start with a UI-first approach. As a user, I was hoping to easily add daily entries about whether I'd exercised, ate healthy meals, or consumed alcohol. I also wanted to record my weight and blood-pressure metrics when I measured them. When I started using the UI I'd just created, it seemed like it might be able to accomplish these goals, but it also seemed somewhat cumbersome. That's when I decided to create a UI mockup with the main screen and its ancillary screens for data entry. I used https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle[OmniGraffle] and a https://viget.com/inspire/twitter-bootstrap-3.0-stencils-for-omnigraffle[Bootstrap stencil] to create the following UI mockup.

[[img-ui-mockup]]
.UI mockup
image::chapter1/ui-mockup.png[UI mockup, 846, scaledwidth=75%, align=center]

After figuring out how I wanted the UI to look, I started to think about the data model. I quickly decided I didn't need to track high-level goals (e.g. lose ten pounds in Q1 2023). I was more concerned with tracking weekly goals and 21-Points Health is all about how many points you get in a week. I created the following diagram as my data model.

[[img-entity-diagram]]
.21-Points Health entity diagram
image::chapter1/entity-diagram.png[21-Points Health entity diagram, 684, scaledwidth=75%, align=center]

I ran `jhipster entity points`. I added the appropriate fields and their validation rules, and specified a many-to-one relationship with `user`. Below is the final output from my answers.

You can see the validation rules for date and notes above, but you don't see how I created the relationship to user. Here are the questions and answers from that section.

? Do you want to add a relationship to another entity? Yes
? What is the name of the other entity? User
? What is the name of the relationship? user
? What is the type of the relationship? many-to-one
? Do you want to add any validation rules to this relationship? No
----

I had similar answers for the `Weight` and `BloodPressure` entities. Please refer to the entity diagram for the field names in each entity. For `Preferences`, I created a one-to-one relationship with `User`.

To ensure that people use 21-Points Health effectively, I set the weekly goal to a minimum of 10 points and a max of 21. I also made the `weightUnits` property an enum.

----
================= Preferences =================
Fields

? What is the type of your field? Enumeration (Java enum type)
? What is the class name of your enumeration? Units

? Do you want to add validation rules to your field? Yes
? Which validation rules do you want to add? Required

TIP: After generating the `Weight` and `BloodPressure` entities with a `date` property for the date/time field, I decided that `timestamp` was a better property name. To fix this, I modified the respective JSON files in the `.jhipster` directory and ran `jhipster entity` for each entity again. This seemed easier than refactoring with IntelliJ and hoping it caught all the name instances.

When I ran `./gradlew test`, I was pleased to see that all tests passed.

I checked in seven changed files and 144 new files generated by the JHipster before continuing to implement my UI mockups.

== Application improvements

To make my new JHipster application into something I could be proud of, I made a number of improvements, described below.

TIP: At this point, I set up continuous testing of this project using https://jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins]. This is covered in the <<Continuous integration and deployment>> section of this chapter.

=== Improved HTML layout and I18N messages

Of all the code I write, UI code (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) is my favorite. I like that you can see changes immediately and make progress quickly - especially when you're using dual monitors with
ifdef::backend-epub3[link:jhipsters-ui-components.xhtml#Browsersync[Browsersync].]
ifndef::backend-epub3[<<Browsersync>>.]
Below is a consolidated list of changes I made to the HTML to make things look better:

* improved layout of tables and buttons,
* improved titles and button labels by editing generated JSON files in `src/main/webapp/i18n/en`,
* formatted dates for local timezone with Angular's DatePipe
  (for example: `{{bloodPressure.timestamp | date:'short'}}`),
* defaulted to current date on new entries,
* replaced point metrics with icons on list/detail screens, and
* replaced point metrics with checkboxes on update screen.

The biggest visual improvements are on the list screens. I made the buttons a bit smaller, turned button text into tooltips, and moved add/search buttons to the top right corner. For the points-list screen, I converted the 1 and 0 metric values to icons. Before and after screenshots of the points list illustrate the improved, compact layout.

[[img-points-list-after]]
.Default Daily Points list after UI improvements
image::chapter1/points-list-after.png[Default Daily Points list after UI improvements, 1136, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

I refactored the HTML at the top of `points.component.html` to put the title, search, and add buttons on the same row. I also removed the button text in favor of a using https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/tooltip/api[ng-bootstrap's tooltip directive]. The `jhiTranslate` directive you see in the button tooltips is provided by https://github.com/jhipster/ng-jhipster[JHipster's Angular library].

                </button>
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>
</div>

Changing the numbers to icons was pretty easy thanks to Angular's expression language.

[source%autofit,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points.component.html
----
<td class="text-center">
    <fa-icon [icon]="points.exercise ? 'check' : 'times'" aria-hidden="true"
             class="{{points.exercise ? 'text-success' : 'text-danger'}}"></fa-icon>
</td>
<td class="text-center">
    <fa-icon [icon]="points.meals ? 'check' : 'times'" aria-hidden="true"
             class="{{points.meals ? 'text-success' : 'text-danger'}}"></fa-icon>
</td>
<td class="text-center">
    <fa-icon [icon]="points.alcohol ? 'check' : 'times'" aria-hidden="true"
             class="{{points.alcohol ? 'text-success' : 'text-danger'}}"></fa-icon>
</td>
----

After adding this HTML, I saw an error in my browser's developer console.

----
FontAwesome: Could not find icon with iconName=check and prefix=fas
----

To fix this, I modified `vendor.ts` and added `faCheck` as an imported icon.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts
----
library.add(faTimes);
library.add(faCheck); // add this line
----

Next, I changed the input fields to checkboxes in `points-update.component.html`.

[source%autofit,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points-update.component.html
----
<div class="form-check">
    <label class="form-check-label" for="field_exercise">
        <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" name="exercise" id="field_exercise"
               [(ngModel)]="points.exercise"  />
        <span jhiTranslate="twentyOnePointsApp.points.exercise" for="field_exercise">Exercise</span>
    </label>
</div>
<div class="form-check">
    <label class="form-check-label" for="field_meals">
        <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" name="meals" id="field_meals"
               [(ngModel)]="points.meals"  />
        <span jhiTranslate="twentyOnePointsApp.points.meals">Meals</span>
    </label>
</div>
<div class="form-check">
    <label class="form-check-label" for="field_alcohol">
        <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" name="alcohol" id="field_alcohol"
               [(ngModel)]="points.alcohol"  />
        <span jhiTranslate="twentyOnePointsApp.points.alcohol" for="field_alcohol">Alcohol</span>
    </label>
</div>
----

In `points-update.component.ts`, I had to modify the `save()` method to convert booleans from each checkbox into integers.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points-update.component.ts
----
save() {
    this.isSaving = true;

    // convert booleans to ints
    this.points.exercise = this.points.exercise ? 1 : 0;
    this.points.meals = this.points.meals ? 1 : 0;
    this.points.alcohol = this.points.alcohol ? 1 : 0;

    if (this.points.id !== undefined) {
        this.subscribeToSaveResponse(this.pointsService.update(this.points));
    } else {
        this.subscribeToSaveResponse(this.pointsService.create(this.points));
    }
}
----

After making these changes, modifying a bit of HTML, and tweaking some i18n messages, the "`Add Points`" screen is starting to look like the UI mockup I created.

[[img-add-points-page]]
.Add Points page
image::chapter1/add-points-page.png[Add Points page, 1167, scaledwidth=90%, align=center]

Improving the UI was the most fun, but also the most time consuming as it involved lots of little tweaks to multiple screens. The next task was more straightforward: implementing business logic.

=== Added logic so non-admin users only see their own data

I wanted to make several improvements to what users could see, based on their roles. A user should be able to see and modify their data, but nobody else's. I also wanted to ensure that an administrator could see and modify everyone's data.

==== Hide user selection from non-admin users

The default update components for many-to-one relationships allow you to choose the user when you add/edit a record. To make it so only administrators had this ability, I modified the update templates and used the `*jhiHasAnyAuthority` directive. This directive is included with JHipster, in `src/main/webapp/app/shared/auth/has-any-authority.directive.ts`. It allows you to pass in a single role or a list of roles.

[source%autofit,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points-update.component.html
----
<div class="form-group" *jhiHasAnyAuthority="'ROLE_ADMIN'">
    <label class="form-control-label" jhiTranslate="twentyOnePointsApp.points.user" for="field_user">User</label>
    <select class="form-control" id="field_user" name="user" [(ngModel)]="points.user">
        <option [ngValue]="null"></option>
        <option [ngValue]="userOption.id === points.user?.id ? points.user : userOption"
                *ngFor="let userOption of users; trackBy: trackUserById">{{userOption.login}}</option>
    </select>
</div>
----

Since the dropdown is hidden from non-admins, I had to modify each `Resource` class to default to the current user when creating a new record. Below is a diff that shows the changes that I needed to make to `PointsResource.java`.

[source%autofit,diff]

             return ResponseEntity.badRequest().headers(
                 HeaderUtil.createFailureAlert(ENTITY_NAME, "idexists",

         Points result = pointsRepository.save(points);
         pointsSearchRepository.save(result);
         return ResponseEntity.created(new URI("/api/points/" + result.getId()))
             .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
             .body(result);
----

`SecurityUtils` is a class JHipster provides when you create a project. I had to modify `PointsResourceIntTest.java` to be security-aware after making this change.

Spring MVC Test provides a convenient interface called `RequestPostProcessor` that you can use to modify a request. Spring Security provides a number of `RequestPostProcessor` implementations that simplify testing. In order to use Spring Security's `RequestPostProcessor` implementations, you can include them all with the following static import.

[source%autofit,java]
----
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.servlet.request.SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;
----

I then modified `PointsResourceIntTest.java`, creating a new `MockMvc` instance that was security-aware and specified `with(user("user"))` to populate Spring Security's `SecurityContext` with an authenticated user.

==== List screen should show only user's data

The next business-logic improvement I wanted was to modify list screens so they'd only show records for current user. Admin users should see all users' data. To facilitate this feature, I modified `PointsResource#getAll` to have a switch based on the user's role. Rather than showing you the diff of method, here's the whole thing.

[source%autofit,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/PointsResource.java
----
public ResponseEntity<List<Points>> getAllPoints(@ApiParam Pageable pageable) {
    log.debug("REST request to get a page of Points");
    Page<Points> page;
    if (SecurityUtils.isCurrentUserInRole(AuthoritiesConstants.ADMIN)) {
        page = pointsRepository.findAllByOrderByDateDesc(pageable);
    } else {
        page = pointsRepository.findByUserIsCurrentUser(pageable);
    }
    HttpHeaders headers = PaginationUtil.generatePaginationHttpHeaders(page, "/api/points");
    return new ResponseEntity<>(page.getContent(), headers, HttpStatus.OK);
}
----

The `PointsRepository#findByUserIsCurrentUser()` method that JHipster generated contains a custom query that uses Spring Expression Language to grab the user's information from Spring Security. I changed it from returning `List<Points>` to returning `Page<Points>`.

[source%autofit,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/repository/PointsRepository.java
----
@Query("select points from Points points where points.user.login = ?#{principal.username}")
Page<Points> findByUserIsCurrentUser(Pageable pageable);
----

[sidebar]
.Ordering by date
--
Later on, I changed the above query to order by date, so the first records in the list would be the most recent.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/repository/PointsRepository.java
----
@Query("select points from Points points where points.user.login = ?#{principal.username} order by points.date desc")
----

In addition, I changed the call to `pointsRepository.findAll` to `pointsRepository.findAllByOrderByDateDesc` so the admin user's query would order by date. The query for this is generated dynamically by Spring Data, simply by adding the method to your repository.

[source,java]
----
Page<Points> findAllByOrderByDateDesc(Pageable pageable);
----
--

To make tests pass, I had to update `PointsResourceIntTest#getAllPoints` to use Spring Security Test's `user` post processor.

[source,diff]
.src/test/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/PointsResourceIntTest.java
----

=== Implementing the UI mockup

Making the homepage into something resembling my UI mockup required several steps:

. Add buttons to facilitate adding new data from the homepage.
. Add an API to get points achieved during the current week.
. Add an API to get blood-pressure readings for the last 30 days.
. Add an API to get body weights for the last 30 days.
. Add charts to display points per week and blood pressure/weight for last 30 days.

I started by reusing the update components for entering data that JHipster had created for me. I navigated to the components using Angular's `routerLink` syntax, copied from each entity's main list page. For example, below is the code for the "Add Points" button.

[source%autofit,html]
----
<a [routerLink]="['/points/new']" class="btn btn-primary m-0 mb-1 text-white">Add Points</a>
----

Then I had to modify `home.component.ts` to listen for the events these components fire when they modify an entity.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.ts
----
import { JhiEventManager } from 'ng-jhipster';
import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Subscription } from 'rxjs';

...
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
    ...
    eventSubscriber: Subscription;

    constructor(..., private eventManager: EventManager) {
    }

    ngOnDestroy() {
        this.eventManager.destroy(this.eventSubscriber);
    }

    registerAuthenticationSuccess() {
        this.eventManager.subscribe('authenticationSuccess', () => {
            this.principal.identity().then((account) => {
                this.account = account;
                this.getUserData();
            });
        });
        this.eventSubscriber = this.eventManager
            .subscribe('pointsListModification', () => this.getUserData());
        this.eventSubscriber = this.eventManager
            .subscribe('bloodPressureListModification', () => this.getUserData());
        this.eventSubscriber = this.eventManager
            .subscribe('weightListModification', () => this.getUserData());
    }
    ...
}
----

==== Points this week

To get points achieved in the current week, I started by adding a unit test to `PointsResourceIntTest.java` that would allow me to prove my API was working.

[source,java]
.src/test/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/PointsResourceIntTest.java
----
private void createPointsByWeek(LocalDate thisMonday, LocalDate lastMonday) {
    User user = userRepository.findOneByLogin("user").get();
    // Create points in two separate weeks
    points = new Points(thisMonday.plusDays(2), 1, 1, 1, user); // <1>
    pointsRepository.saveAndFlush(points);

    points = new Points(thisMonday.plusDays(3), 1, 1, 0, user);
    pointsRepository.saveAndFlush(points);

    points = new Points(lastMonday.plusDays(3), 0, 0, 1, user);
    pointsRepository.saveAndFlush(points);

    points = new Points(lastMonday.plusDays(4), 1, 1, 0, user);
    pointsRepository.saveAndFlush(points);
}

@Test
@Transactional
public void getPointsThisWeek() throws Exception {
    LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
    LocalDate thisMonday = today.with(DayOfWeek.MONDAY);
    LocalDate lastMonday = thisMonday.minusWeeks(1);
    createPointsByWeek(thisMonday, lastMonday);

    // create security-aware mockMvc
    restPointsMockMvc = MockMvcBuilders
        .webAppContextSetup(context)
        .apply(springSecurity())
        .build();

    // Get all the points
    restPointsMockMvc.perform(get("/api/points")
        .with(user("user").roles("USER")))
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(content().contentTypeCompatibleWith(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$", hasSize(4)));

    // Get the points for this week only
    restPointsMockMvc.perform(get("/api/points-this-week")
        .with(user("user").roles("USER")))
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(content().contentTypeCompatibleWith(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$.week").value(thisMonday.toString()))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$.points").value(5));
}
----
<1> To simplify testing, I added a new constructor to `Points.java` that contained the arguments I wanted to set. I continued this pattern for most tests I created.

Of course, this test failed when I first ran it since `/api/points-this-week` didn't exist in `PointsResource.java`. You might notice the points-this-week API expects two return values: a date in the `week` field and the number of points in the `points` field. I created `PointsPerWeek.java` in my project's `rest.vm` package to hold this information.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/vm/PointsPerWeek.java
----
package org.jhipster.health.web.rest.vm;

import java.time.LocalDate;

public class PointsPerWeek {
    private LocalDate week;
    private Integer points;

    public PointsPerWeek(LocalDate week, Integer points) {
        this.week = week;
        this.points = points;
    }

    public Integer getPoints() {
        return points;
    }

    public void setPoints(Integer points) {
        this.points = points;
    }

    public LocalDate getWeek() {
        return week;
    }

    public void setWeek(LocalDate week) {
        this.week = week;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "PointsThisWeek{" +
            "points=" + points +
            ", week=" + week +
            '}';
    }
}
----

Spring Data JPA made it easy to find all point entries in a particular week. I added a new method to my `PointsRepository.java` that allowed me to query between two dates.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/repository/PointsRepository.java
----
List<Points> findAllByDateBetweenAndUserLogin(LocalDate firstDate, LocalDate secondDate, String login);
----

From there, it was just a matter of calculating the beginning and end of the current week and processing the data in `PointsResource.java`.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/PointsResource.java
----
/**
 * GET  /points : get all the points for the current week.
 */
@GetMapping("/points-this-week")
@Timed
public ResponseEntity<PointsPerWeek> getPointsThisWeek(
    @RequestParam(value="tz", required=false) String timezone) {

    // Get current date (with timezone if passed in)
    LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();
    if (timezone != null) {
        now = LocalDate.now(ZoneId.of(timezone));
    }

    // Get first day of week
    LocalDate startOfWeek = now.with(DayOfWeek.MONDAY);
    // Get last day of week
    LocalDate endOfWeek = now.with(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY);
    log.debug("Looking for points between: {} and {}", startOfWeek, endOfWeek);

    List<Points> points =
        pointsRepository.findAllByDateBetweenAndUserLogin(
            startOfWeek, endOfWeek, SecurityUtils.getCurrentUserLogin());
    return calculatePoints(startOfWeek, points);
}

private ResponseEntity<PointsPerWeek> calculatePoints(LocalDate startOfWeek,
                                                      List<Points> points) {
    Integer numPoints = points.stream()
        .mapToInt(p -> p.getExercise() + p.getMeals() + p.getAlcohol())
        .sum();

    PointsPerWeek count = new PointsPerWeek(startOfWeek, numPoints);
    return new ResponseEntity<>(count, HttpStatus.OK);
}
----

To support this new method on the client, I added a new method to `PointsService` in `src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points.service.ts`.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/points/points.service.ts
----
thisWeek(): Observable<EntityResponseType> {
    const tz = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
    return this.http
        .get(`api/points-this-week?tz=${tz}`, { observe: 'response' })
        .pipe(map((res: EntityResponseType) => this.convertDateFromServer(res)));
}
----

Then I added the service as a dependency to `home.component.ts` and calculated the data I wanted to display.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.ts
----
import { Account, LoginModalService, Principal } from 'app/core';
import { PreferencesService } from 'app/entities/preferences';
import { BloodPressureService } from 'app/entities/blood-pressure';
import { WeightService } from 'app/entities/weight';
import { D3ChartService } from './d3-chart.service';
import { Preferences } from 'app/shared/model/preferences.model';

...
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
    account: Account;
    modalRef: NgbModalRef;
    pointsThisWeek: any = {};
    pointsPercentage: number;

    constructor(private principal: Principal,
                private loginModalService: LoginModalService,
                private eventManager: EventManager,
                private pointsService: PointsService) {
    }

    getUserData() {
        // Get points for the current week
        this.pointsService.thisWeek().subscribe((points: any) => {
            points = points.body;
            this.pointsThisWeek = points;
            this.pointsPercentage = (points.points / 21) * 100;
        });
    }
    ...
}
----

I added a progress bar to `home.component.html` to show points-this-week progress.

[source,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.html
----
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-11">
        <ngb-progressbar max="21" [value]="pointsThisWeek.points"
                         [hidden]="!pointsThisWeek.points" [striped]="true">
            <span *ngIf="pointsThisWeek.points">
                {{pointsThisWeek.points}} / Goal: 10
            </span>
        </ngb-progressbar>
        <ngb-alert [dismissible]="false" [hidden]="pointsThisWeek.points">
            <span jhiTranslate="home.points.getMoving">
                No points yet this week, better get moving!</span>
        </ngb-alert>
    </div>
</div>
----

Below is a screenshot of what this progress bar looked like after restarting the server and entering some data for the current user.

[[img-homepage-progress-bar]]
.Progress bar for points this week
image::chapter1/homepage-points-this-week.png[Progress bar for points this week, 1330, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

You might notice the goal is hardcoded to 10 in the progress bar's HTML. To fix this, I needed to add the ability to fetch the user's preferences. To make it easier to access a user's preferences, I modified `PreferencesRepository.java` and added a method to retrieve a user's preferences.

[source%autofit,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/repository/PreferencesRepository.java
----
public interface PreferencesRepository extends JpaRepository<Preferences, Long> {
    Optional<Preferences> findOneByUserLogin(String login);
}
----

I created a new method in `PreferencesResource.java` to return the user's preferences (or a default weekly goal of 10 points if no preferences are defined).

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/PreferencesResource.java
----
/**
 * GET  /my-preferences -> get the current user's preferences.
 */
@GetMapping("/my-preferences")
@Timed
public ResponseEntity<Preferences> getUserPreferences() {
    String username = SecurityUtils.getCurrentUserLogin().get();
    log.debug("REST request to get Preferences : {}", username);
    Optional<Preferences> preferences =
        preferencesRepository.findOneByUserLogin(username);

    if (preferences.isPresent()) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(preferences.get(), HttpStatus.OK);
    } else {
        Preferences defaultPreferences = new Preferences();
        defaultPreferences.setWeeklyGoal(10); // default
        return new ResponseEntity<>(defaultPreferences, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
----

To facilitate calling this endpoint, I added a new `user` method to the `PreferencesService` in the client.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/preferences/preferences.service.ts
----
user(): Observable<EntityResponseType> {
    return this.http.get<IPreferences>('api/my-preferences', { observe: 'response' });
}
----

In `home.component.ts`, I added the `PreferencesService` as a dependency and set the preferences in a local `preferences` variable so the HTML template could read it. I also added a listener for `preference` updates and logic to calculate the background color of the progress bar.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.ts
----
export class HomeComponent implements OnInit, OnDestory {
    ...
    preferences: Preferences;

    constructor(...
                private preferencesService: PreferencesService,
                private pointsService: PointsService) {
    }

    registerAuthenticationSuccess() {
        ...
        this.eventSubscriber = this.eventManager.subscribe(
            'preferencesListModification', () => this.getUserData());
    }

    getUserData() {
        // Get preferences
        this.preferencesService.user().subscribe((preferences: any) => {
            this.preferences = preferences.body;

            // Get points for the current week
            this.pointsService.thisWeek().subscribe((points: any) => {
                points = points.body;
                this.pointsThisWeek = points;
                this.pointsPercentage =
                    (points.points / this.preferences.weeklyGoal) * 100;

                // calculate success, warning, or danger
                if (points.points >= preferences.weeklyGoal) {
                    this.pointsThisWeek.progress = 'success';
                } else if (points.points < 10) {
                    this.pointsThisWeek.progress = 'danger';
                } else if (points.points > 10 &&
                    points.points < this.preferences.weeklyGoal) {
                    this.pointsThisWeek.progress = 'warning';
                }
            });
            ...
        });
    }
    ...
}
----

Now that a user's preferences were available, I modified `home.component.html` to display the user's weekly goal, as well as to color the progress bar appropriately with a `[type]` attribute.

[source,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.html
----
<ngb-progressbar max="21" [value]="pointsThisWeek.points"
                 [type]="pointsThisWeek.progress" [striped]="true"
                 [hidden]="!pointsThisWeek.points">
    <span *ngIf="pointsThisWeek.points">
        {{pointsThisWeek.points}} / Goal: {{preferences.weeklyGoal}}
    </span>a
</ngb-progressbar>
<ngb-alert [dismissible]="false" [hidden]="pointsThisWeek.points">
    <span jhiTranslate="home.points.getMoving">
        No points yet this week, better get moving!</span>
</ngb-alert>
----

To finish things off, I added a link to a component where users could edit their preferences.

[source,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.html
----
<a [routerLink]="['/preferences', preferences.id, 'edit']"
   class="float-right" jhiTranslate="home.link.preferences">Edit Preferences</a>
----

==== Blood pressure and weight for the last 30 days

To populate the two remaining charts on the homepage, I needed to fetch the user's blood-pressure readings and weights for the last 30 days. I added a method to `BloodPressureResourceIntTest.java` to set up my expectations.

[source%autofit,java]
.src/test/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/BloodPressureResourceIntTest.java
----
private void createBloodPressureByMonth(ZonedDateTime firstDate,
                                        ZonedDateTime firstDayOfLastMonth) {
    User user = userRepository.findOneByLogin("user").get();

    bloodPressure = new BloodPressure(firstDate, 120, 80, user);
    bloodPressureRepository.saveAndFlush(bloodPressure);
    bloodPressure = new BloodPressure(firstDate.plusDays(10), 125, 75, user);
    bloodPressureRepository.saveAndFlush(bloodPressure);
    bloodPressure = new BloodPressure(firstDate.plusDays(20), 100, 69, user);
    bloodPressureRepository.saveAndFlush(bloodPressure);

    // last month
    bloodPressure = new BloodPressure(firstDayOfLastMonth, 130, 90, user);
    bloodPressureRepository.saveAndFlush(bloodPressure);
    bloodPressure = new BloodPressure(firstDayOfLastMonth.plusDays(11), 135, 85, user);
    bloodPressureRepository.saveAndFlush(bloodPressure);
    bloodPressure = new BloodPressure(firstDayOfLastMonth.plusDays(23), 130, 75, user);
    bloodPressureRepository.saveAndFlush(bloodPressure);
}

@Test
@Transactional
public void getBloodPressureForLast30Days() throws Exception {
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now();
    ZonedDateTime twentyNineDaysAgo = now.minusDays(29);
    ZonedDateTime firstDayOfLastMonth = now.withDayOfMonth(1).minusMonths(1);
    createBloodPressureByMonth(twentyNineDaysAgo, firstDayOfLastMonth);

    // create security-aware mockMvc
    restBloodPressureMockMvc = MockMvcBuilders
        .webAppContextSetup(context)
        .apply(springSecurity())
        .build();

    // Get all the blood pressure readings
    restBloodPressureMockMvc.perform(get("/api/blood-pressures")
        .with(user("user").roles("USER")))
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(content().contentTypeCompatibleWith(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$", hasSize(6)));

    // Get the blood pressure readings for the last 30 days
    restBloodPressureMockMvc.perform(get("/api/bp-by-days/{days}", 30)
        .with(user("user").roles("USER")))
        .andDo(print())
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(content().contentTypeCompatibleWith(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$.period").value("Last 30 Days"))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$.readings.[*].systolic").value(hasItem(120)))
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$.readings.[*].diastolic").value(hasItem(69)));
}
----

I created a `BloodPressureByPeriod.java` class to return the results from the API.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/vm/BloodPressureByPeriod.java
----
public class BloodPressureByPeriod {
    private String period;
    private List<BloodPressure> readings;

    public BloodPressureByPeriod(String period, List<BloodPressure> readings) {
        this.period = period;
        this.readings = readings;
    }
    ...
}
----

Using similar logic that I used for points-this-week, I created a new method in `BloodPressureRepository.java` that allowed me to query between two different dates. I also added "`OrderBy`" logic so the records would be sorted by date entered.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/repository/BloodPressureRepository.java
----
List<BloodPressure> findAllByTimestampBetweenOrderByTimestampDesc(
    ZonedDateTime firstDate, ZonedDateTime secondDate);
----

Next, I created a new method in `BloodPressureResource.java` that calculated the first and last days of the current month, executed the query for the current user, and constructed the data to return.

[source%autofit,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/BloodPressureResource.java
----
/**
 * GET  /bp-by-days : get all the blood pressure readings by last x days.
 */
@RequestMapping(value = "/bp-by-days/{days}")
@Timed
public ResponseEntity<BloodPressureByPeriod> getByDays(@PathVariable int days) {
    ZonedDateTime rightNow = ZonedDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC);
    ZonedDateTime daysAgo = rightNow.minusDays(days);

    List<BloodPressure> readings =
        bloodPressureRepository.findAllByTimestampBetweenOrderByTimestampDesc(daysAgo, rightNow);
    BloodPressureByPeriod response =
        new BloodPressureByPeriod("Last " + days + " Days", filterByUser(readings));
    return new ResponseEntity<>(response, HttpStatus.OK);
}

private List<BloodPressure> filterByUser(List<BloodPressure> readings) {
    Stream<BloodPressure> userReadings = readings.stream()
        .filter(bp -> bp.getUser().getLogin().equals(SecurityUtils.getCurrentLogin().get()));
    return userReadings.collect(Collectors.toList());
}
----

.Filtering by method
****
I later learned how to do the filtering in the database by adding the following method to `BloodPressureRepository.java`:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/repository/BloodPressureRepository.java
----
List<BloodPressure> findAllByTimestampBetweenAndUserLoginOrderByTimestampDesc(
        ZonedDateTime firstDate, ZonedDateTime secondDate, String login);
----

Then I was able to remove the `filterByUser` method and change `BloodPressureResource#getByDays` to be:

[source%autofit,java]
.src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/web/rest/BloodPressureResource.java
----
public ResponseEntity<BloodPressureByPeriod> getByDays(@PathVariable int days) {
    ZonedDateTime rightNow = ZonedDateTime.now();
    ZonedDateTime daysAgo = rightNow.minusDays(days);

    List<BloodPressure> readings =
        bloodPressureRepository.findAllByTimestampBetweenAndUserLoginOrderByTimestampDesc(
            daysAgo, rightNow, SecurityUtils.getCurrentUserLogin().get());
    BloodPressureByPeriod response =
        new BloodPressureByPeriod("Last " + days + " Days", readings);
    return new ResponseEntity<>(response, HttpStatus.OK);
}
----
****

I added a new method to support this API in `blood-pressure.service.ts`.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/entities/blood-pressure/blood-pressure.service.ts
----
last30Days(): Observable<EntityResponseType> {
    return this.http
        .get('api/bp-by-days/30', { observe: 'response' })
        .pipe(map((res: EntityResponseType) => this.convertDateFromServer(res)));
}
----

While gathering this data seemed easy enough, the hard part was figuring out what charting library to use to display it.

==== Charts of the last 30 days

Based on my experience writing the first two versions of this book, I looked for an Angular library that integrated with https://d3js.org/[D3.js] and found https://github.com/krispo/ng2-nvd3[ng2-nvd3]. To install ng2-nvd3, I used npm.

----
npm install ng2-nvd3
----

Then I updated `home.module.ts` to import the `NvD3Module`, as well as other imports I found necessary.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.module.ts
----
import { NvD3Module } from 'ng2-nvd3';
import 'd3';
import 'nvd3';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        TwentyOnePointsSharedModule,
        NvD3Module,
        ...
    ],
    ...
})
export class TwentyOnePointsHomeModule {}
----

I modified `home.component.ts` to have the `BloodPressureService` as a dependency and went to work building the data so D3 could render it. I found that charts required a bit of JSON to configure them, so I created a service to contain this configuration.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/d3-chart.service.ts
----
declare const d3, nv: any;

/**
 * ChartService to define the chart config for D3
 */
export class D3ChartService {

    static getChartConfig() {
        const today = new Date();
        const priorDate = new Date().setDate(today.getDate() - 30);
        return {
            chart: {

            }
        };
    }
}
----

In `home.component.ts`, I grabbed the blood-pressure readings from the API and morphed them into data that D3 could understand.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.ts
----
// Get blood pressure readings for the last 30 days
this.bloodPressureService.last30Days().subscribe((bpReadings: any) => {
    bpReadings = bpReadings.body;
    this.bpReadings = bpReadings;
    this.bpOptions = {... D3ChartService.getChartConfig() };
    if (bpReadings.readings.length) {
        this.bpOptions.title.text = bpReadings.period;
        this.bpOptions.chart.yAxis.axisLabel = 'Blood Pressure';
        let systolics, diastolics, upperValues, lowerValues;
        systolics = [];
        diastolics = [];
        upperValues = [];
        lowerValues = [];
        bpReadings.readings.forEach((item) => {
            systolics.push({
                x: new Date(item.timestamp),
                y: item.systolic
            });
            diastolics.push({
                x: new Date(item.timestamp),
                y: item.diastolic
            });
            upperValues.push(item.systolic);
            lowerValues.push(item.diastolic);
        });
        this.bpData = [{
            values: systolics,
            key: 'Systolic',
            color: '#673ab7'
        }, {
            values: diastolics,
            key: 'Diastolic',
            color: '#03a9f4'
        }];
        // set y scale to be 10 more than max and min
        this.bpOptions.chart.yDomain =
          [Math.min.apply(Math, lowerValues) - 10,
                          Math.max.apply(Math, upperValues) + 10];
    } else {
        this.bpReadings.readings = [];
    }
});
----

Finally, I used the "`nvd3`" directive in `home.component.html` to read `bpOptions` and `bpData`, then display a chart.

[source,html]
.src/main/webapp/app/home/home.component.html
----
<div class="row mt-1">
    <div class="col-md-11 col-xs-12">
        <span *ngIf="bpReadings.readings && bpReadings.readings.length">
            <nvd3 [options]="bpOptions" [data]="bpData"
                  class="with-3d-shadow with-transitions"></nvd3>
        </span>
        <ngb-alert [dismissible]="false"
            [hidden]="bpReadings.readings && bpReadings.readings.length">
            <span jhiTranslate="home.bloodPressure.noReadings">
                No blood pressure readings found.
            </span>
        </ngb-alert>
    </div>
</div>
----

After entering some test data, I was quite pleased with the results.

[[img-homepage-bp-last-30-days]]
.Chart of blood pressure during the last 30 days
image::chapter1/homepage-bp-last-30-days.png[Chart of blood pressure during the last 30 days, 1281, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

I made similar changes to display weights for the last 30 days as a chart.

=== Lines of code

After finishing the MVP (minimum viable product) of 21-Points Health, I did some quick calculations to see how many lines of code JHipster produced. You can see from the graph below that I only had to write 2,080 lines of code. JHipster did the rest for me, generating 91.2% of the code in my project!

[[img-21-points-loc]]
.Project lines of code
image::chapter1/21-points-loc.png[Project lines of code, 600, scaledwidth=60%, align=center]

To drill down further, I made a graph of the top three languages in the project: Java, TypeScript, and HTML.

[[img-21-points-loc-by-language]]
.Project lines of code by language
image::chapter1/21-points-loc-by-language.png[Project lines of code by language, 700, scaledwidth=70%, align=center]

The amount of code I had to write in each language was 561 lines of TypeScript, 687 lines of Java, and 351 lines of HTML. The other 481 lines were JSON (135), XML (187), Sass (80), YAML (54), CSS (12), Markdown (6), Groovy (4), and Bourne Shell (3).

Wahoo! Thanks, JHipster!

.Testing
****
You probably noticed that a lot of the Java code I wrote was for the tests. I felt that these tests were essential to prove that the business logic I implemented was correct. It's never easy to work with dates but Java 8's Date-Time API greatly simplified it and Spring Data JPA made it easy to write "`between date`" queries.

I believe TDD (test-driven development) is a great way to write code. However, when developing UIs, I tend to make them work before writing tests. It's usually a very visual activity and, with the aid of Browsersync, there's rarely a delay before you see your changes. I like to write unit tests for my Angular components and directives using https://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine] and I like to write integration tests with http://www.protractortest.org/#/[Protractor].

I did not show any UI tests in this section, but JHipster generated a bunch for me. Running `npm test --coverage` shows 78.98% of lines are covered in the UI!

== Deploying to Heroku

JHipster ships with support for deploying to Google App Engine, Heroku, and Kubernetes including Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and Digital Ocean. I used Heroku to deploy my application to the cloud because I'd worked with it before. When you prepare a JHipster application for production, it's recommended to use the pre-configured "`prod`" profile. With Gradle, you can package your application by specifying this profile when building.

----
./gradle bootJar -Pprod
----

The command looks similar when using Maven.

----
./mvnw package -Pprod
----

The production profile is used to build an optimized JavaScript client. You can invoke this using webpack by running `npm run webapp:build:prod`. The production profile also configures gzip compression with a servlet filter, cache headers, and monitoring via https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer]. If you have a https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] server configured in your `application-prod.yml` file, your application will automatically send metrics data to it.

To deploy 21-Points Health, I logged in to my Heroku account. I already had the https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli[Heroku CLI] installed.

TIP: I first deployed to Heroku after creating the application, meaning that I had a default JHipster application with no entities.

----

I ran `jhipster heroku` as recommended in the https://www.jhipster.tech/heroku/[Deploying to Heroku] documentation. I tried using the name "`21points`" for my application when prompted.

----
$ jhipster heroku

----

You can see my first attempt failed for the same reason that creating the initial JHipster app failed: it didn't like that the app name started with a number. I tried again with "`health`", but that failed, too, since a Heroku app with this name already existed. Finally, I settled on "`health-by-points`" as the application name.

I ran `git checkout .yo-rc.json` to revert the changes the Heroku sub-generator made, then tried again. I typed "`a`" when prompted to overwrite `build.gradle`.

I was pumped to see that this process worked and that my application was available at http://health-by-points.herokuapp.com. I quickly changed the default passwords for *admin* and *user* to make things more secure.

[[img-deployed-to-heroku]]
.First deployment to Heroku
image::chapter1/deployed-to-heroku.png[First deployment to Heroku, 1225, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Next, I bought the 21-points.com domain from https://domains.google.com[Google Domains]. To configure this domain for Heroku, I ran `heroku domains:add`.

----
$ heroku domains:add www.21-points.com

----

I read the https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains[documentation], then went to work configuring DNS settings on Google Domains. I configured a subdomain forward of:

----
21-points.com → http://www.21-points.com
----

I also configured a custom resource record with a CNAME to point to `health-by-points.herokuapp.com`.

.Custom resource record on Google Domains
|===
|Name |Type |TTL |Data

|*
|CNAME
|1h
|health-by-points.herokuapp.com
|===

This was all I needed to get my JHipster application running on Heroku. For subsequent deployments, I ran `jhipster heroku` again, or used `git push heroku main`.

[sidebar]
.JAR Deployments to Heroku
--
If you use JAR deployments with Heroku, in addition to using `jhipster heroku` you can redeploy your application using https://github.com/heroku/heroku-cli-deploy[heroku-cli-deploy]. Use the following command to install this plugin.

----
heroku plugins:install heroku-cli-deploy
----

After that, you can package your JHipster project for production and deploy it. Using Gradle, it looks like this.

----
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod
heroku jar:deploy build/libs/*.jar --app health-by-points
----

With Maven, the commands look slightly different:

----
./mvnw package -Pprod
heroku jar:deploy target/*.jar --app health-by-points
----
--

=== Elasticsearch on Heroku

To prove everything was working on Heroku, I tried registering a new user. I received an error that appeared to come from Elasticsearch.

[source%autofit]
----
2022-11-08T05:17:22.489474+00:00 app[web.1]: 2022-11-08T05:17:22.488Z ERROR 4 --- [  XNIO-1 task-3]

  Handler dispatch failed; nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: INDEX_CONTENT_TYPE
----

I https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/20315[created an issue] in the JHipster project saying that Elasticsearch doesn't work out of the box with Heroku. I contacted the Elastic team to determine the best solution. They recommended https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?elektra=home[starting a free trial] on Elastic Cloud. After logging in, I created a deployment called *21-Points Health*. I used the default settings, selected *7.17.7* as the version, and pressed *Create deployment*.

[[img-elastic-cloud-settings]]
.Elastic Cloud settings
image::chapter1/elastic-cloud-settings.png[Elastic Cloud settings, 781, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

NOTE: I tried the latest version, but it resulted in a "Unable to parse response body" error.

I downloaded my credentials from the following screen and clicked *Continue*. Next, I selected *Manage this deployment* from the menu and copied the Elasticsearch endpoint.

I set the credentials and endpoint URL as a new `ELASTIC_URL` environment variable on Heroku.

[source,shell]
----
heroku config:set ELASTIC_URL=https://elastic:<my-password>@points-health.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io
----

To fix my JHipster app, so it'd recognize this variable, I modified `heroku.gradle` to remove the workaround for Bansai (that no longer works):

[source,groovy]
.gradle/heroku.gradle
----
// force dependency version as used bonsai add-on as of now only supports 7.10.x
// https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/18650
def bonsaiElasticSearchVersion = "7.10.2"
if (System.getenv("DYNO") != null) {
    configurations {
        all {
            resolutionStrategy {
                force "org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-client:${bonsaiElasticSearchVersion}"
                force "org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client:${bonsaiElasticSearchVersion}"
                force "org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch:${bonsaiElasticSearchVersion}"
                force "org.elasticsearch.plugin:transport-netty4-client:${bonsaiElasticSearchVersion}"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

And I updated `application-heroku.yml` to use `ELASTIC_URL`.

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/config/application-heroku.yml
----
spring:
  ...
  elasticsearch:
    uris: ${ELASTIC_URL}
----

I committed these changes and ran `git push heroku main` to redeploy the application.

=== Mail on Heroku

This time, when I tried to register, I received an error when my `MailService` tried to send me an activation e-mail.

[source%autofit]
----
2022-11-27T22:05:47.068322+00:00 app[web.1]: 2022-11-27T22:05:47.067Z  WARN 4 --- [e-points-task-2]

  (Connection refused). Failed messages: com.sun.mail.util.MailConnectException:
  Couldn't connect to host, port: localhost, 25; timeout -1;
----

I'd used Heroku's https://addons.heroku.com/sendgrid[SendGrid] for e-mail in the past, so I added it to my project.

----
$ heroku addons:create sendgrid
Creating sendgrid on ⬢ health-by-points... free
Created sendgrid-spherical-88389 as SENDGRID_PASSWORD, SENDGRID_USERNAME
Use heroku addons:docs sendgrid to view documentation
----

Then I updated `application-prod.yml` to use `SENDGRID_API_USER` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variables for mail, as well as to turn on authentication.

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml
----
spring:
  ...
  mail:
    host: smtp.sendgrid.net
    port: 587
    username: ${SENDGRID_API_USER}
    password: ${SENDGRID_API_KEY}
    protocol: smtp
    properties:
      tls: false
      auth: true
----

I also changed the `jhipster.mail.*` properties further down in this file.

[source,yaml]
----
jhipster:
  ...
  mail: # specific JHipster mail property, for standard properties see MailProperties
    base-url: http://www.21-points.com
    from: app@21-points.com
----

The `SENDGRID_USERNAME` and `SENDGRID_PASSWORD` variables will not work to send email. You need to create an API Key instead. You can do this by navigating to your app in Heroku's dashboard. Then, select *Resources* > *Twilio SendGrid* and then the *Setup Guide* at the bottom. Create a sender identity that matches the `from` value above. Then, create an API key using the https://app.sendgrid.com/guide/integrate/langs/smtp[SMTP Relay integration].

[[img-sendgrid-api-key]]
.Create SendGrid API key
image::chapter1/sendgrid-api-key.png[Create SendGrid API key, 854, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Once you have an API key, set the user and password for SendGrid on Heroku:

[source,shell]
----
heroku config:set SENDGRID_API_USER=apikey SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
----

After redeploying, I logged in to my Heroku app with administrator credentials and deleted the user I'd tried to add previously. I added the user again and was smiled when I received the activation email.

== Monitoring and analytics

JHipster generates the code necessary for Google Analytics in every application's `src/main/webapp/index.html` file. I chose not to enable this just yet, but I hope to eventually. I already have a Google Analytics account, so it's just a matter of creating a new account for www.21-points.com, copying the account number, and modifying the following section of `index.html`:

[source,html]
.src/main/webapp/index.html
----
<!-- Google Analytics: uncomment and change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID.
<script>
  (function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
  function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;
  e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];
  e.src='//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';
  r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));
  ga('create','UA-XXXXX-X');ga('send','pageview');
</script>-->
----

I've used http://newrelic.com/[New Relic] to monitor my production applications in the past. There is a free https://addons.heroku.com/newrelic[New Relic add-on] for Heroku. Heroku's https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/newrelic[New Relic APM] describes how to set things up if you're letting Heroku do the build for you (meaning, you deploy with `git push heroku main`). However, if you're using the heroku-deploy plugin, it's a bit different.

For that, you'll first need to manually download the New Relic agent, as well as a `newrelic.yml` license file, and put them in the root directory of your project. Then you can run commands like:

----
./gradlew bootJar -Pheroku,prod
heroku buildpacks:clear
heroku jar:deploy build/libs/*.jar --includes newrelic-agent.jar:newrelic.yml
----

That will include the JAR in the slug. Then you'll need to modify your Procfile to include the `javaagent` argument:

----
web: java -javaagent:newrelic-agent.jar $JAVA_OPTS -Xmx256m -jar build/libs/*.jar ...
----

NOTE: If you want to deploy using `git push heroku main` after using the heroku-deploy plugin, you'll have to run `heroku buildpacks:clear`.

To ensure `newrelic-agent.jar` is included when running `git push`, you'll need to modify your `.gitignore` to allow it and add it to Git with `git add newrelic.jar`.

----
*.jar
!newrelic-agent.jar
----

== Securing user data

After running the 5.0 version of 21-Points Health on Heroku for a couple of weeks, someone reported https://github.com/mraible/21-points/issues/49[an issue with security on GitHub]. They pointed out that if you searched, you could see another user's data. I also discovered you could edit data based on the URL too.

To fix this data leakage, I enhanced the Java code so it only allows users that own an entity to edit it. Here's some pseudocode to show the logic:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Points> points = pointsRepository.findById(id);
if (points.isPresent() && <user doesn't match current user>) {
    return new ResponseEntity<>("error.http.403", HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
}
return ResponseUtil.wrapOrNotFound(points);
----

// todo: create a new pull request that shows this change
See https://github.com/mraible/21-points/pull/52/files[pull request #52] for all the changes that I needed to make in resource classes and their tests.

== Continuous integration and deployment

After generating entities for this project, I wanted to configure a continuous-integration (CI) server to build/test/deploy whenever I checked in changes to Git. I chose https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins] for my CI server and used the simplest configuration possible: I downloaded `jenkins.war` to `/opt/tools/jenkins` on my MacBook Pro. I started it with the following command.

----
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9000
----

JHipster has good documentation on https://www.jhipster.tech/setting-up-ci-jenkins2/[setting up CI on Jenkins 2] and https://www.jhipster.tech/heroku/[deploying to Heroku]. It also has a handy sub-generator to generate the config files needed for Jenkins. I ran `jhipster ci-cd` and watched the magic happen.

When choosing Jenkins, you can also select the following options for tasks/integrations:

* Deploy artifact to an Artifactory.
* Analyze code with Sonar.
* Build and publish a Docker image.
* Add Snyk dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities.

To log in to Jenkins, I navigated to http://localhost:9000. I copied the password from the startup log file and pasted it in the unlock Jenkins page.

I created a new job called "21-points" with a Pipeline script from SCM. I configured a "`Poll SCM`" build trigger with a schedule of `H/5 * * * *`. After saving the job, I confirmed it ran successfully.

TIP: It's possible the `deployment` stage will fail for you the first time (like it did for me above). If this happens, stop Jenkins, run `heroku login`, then restart Jenkins.

I modified `Jenkinsfile` to add a `e2e tests` stage to run all the Cypress tests. Before I checked it in, I started the app in one terminal and ran `npm run e2e` in another. I discovered the footer covered the bottom of the points edit form. I had to adjust `points.cy.ts` to force button clicks on lines 121 and 131.

I checked in my changes to trigger another build.

I was pumped to see all the stages in my pipeline pass.

When working on this project, I'd start Jenkins and have it running while I checked in code. I did not install it on a server and leave it running continuously. My reason was simple: I was only coding in bursts and didn't need to waste computing cycles or want to pay for a cloud instance to run it.

== Code quality

When I finished developing the app, I wanted to ensure that I had good code quality and that things were well tested. JHipster generates apps with high code quality by default. Code quality is analyzed using Sonar, which is automatically configured by JHipster. The "code quality" metric is determined by the percentage of code that is covered by tests. To see the code quality for my finished app, I started all the Docker containers that the prod profile needs, plus Sonar.

[source]
----
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/elasticsearch.yml up -d
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
----

Then I ran all the tests and the `sonarqube` task.

[source]
----
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
----

Once this process completed, an analysis of the project was available on the Sonar dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:9001. 21-Points Heath is a triple-A-rated app! Not bad, eh?

== Progressive web apps

Progressive web apps, aka PWAs, are the best way for developers to make their web apps load faster and perform better. In a nutshell, PWAs are websites that use recent web standards to allow for installation on a user's computer or device, and deliver an app-like experience to those users.

To be a PWA requires three features:

1. The app must be served over HTTPS.
2. The app must register a service worker so it can cache requests and work offline.
3. The app must have a web-app manifest with installation information and icons.

For HTTPS, you can use JHipster's "tls" profile for localhost or (even better) deploy it to production!

TIP: To use HTTPS on localhost with Gradle, run `./gradlew -Ptls` for the back end and `yarn start-tls` for the front end.

Cloud providers like Heroku and Cloud Foundry will provide you with HTTPS out of the box, but they won't force it. To force HTTPS, I modified `src/main/java/org/jhipster/health/config/SecurityConfiguration.java` and added a rule to force a secure channel when an `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is sent.

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        ...
    .and()
        .apply(securityConfigurerAdapter())
    .and()
        .requiresChannel()
        .requestMatchers(r -> r.getHeader("X-Forwarded-Proto") != null)
        .requiresSecure();
}
----

The https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin[workbox-webpack-plugin] is configured already for generating a service worker, but it only works when running your app with a production profile. This is nice because it means your data isn't cached in the browser when you're developing.

To register a service worker, I modified `src/main/webapp/index.html` and uncommented the following block of code.

[source,html]
----
<script>
   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
       window.addEventListener('load', function() {
           navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
               .then(function () {
                   console.log('Service Worker Registered');
               });
       });
   }
</script>
----

The final feature — a web-app manifest — is already included at `src/main/webapp/manifest.webapp`. It defines an app name, colors, and icons.

After making these changes, I redeployed 21-Points Health to production and used https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/[Lighthouse] to perform an analysis. You can see the results in the screenshot below.

[[lighthouse-analysis]]

You can see there's still some performance improvements that need to be made. Rather than address those here, I've https://github.com/mraible/21-points/issues/48/[created an issue] you can subscribe to.

== Source code

After getting this application into a good enough state, I moved it from Bitbucket to GitHub and made it available as an open-source project. You can find the source code for 21-Points Health at https://github.com/mraible/21-points.

== Upgrading 21-Points Health

After I finished developing the MVP of 21-Points Health with JHipster 5.3.0, I wanted to upgrade it to the latest release. I used the https://www.jhipster.tech/upgrading-an-application/[upgrade sub-generator], and upgraded it to 5.3.4, then again to 5.4.2.

TIP: If the upgrade sub-generator doesn't work for you when upgrading JHipster, you can manually upgrade. You'll want to make sure your project is checked into source control first. Then, create a new branch and run `rm -rf *` in your project, followed by `jhipster --with-entities`. After this process completes, use your favorite tool (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) to compare changed files and restore your custom code.

If you're reading this and notice that 21-Points Health is using a version newer than 5.4.2, it's likely because I upgraded again.

== Summary

This section showed you how I created a health-tracking web application with JHipster. It walked you through upgrading to the latest release of JHipster and how to generate code with `jhipster entity`. You learned how to do test-first development when writing new APIs and how Spring Data JPA makes it easy to add custom queries. You also saw how to reuse existing components on different pages, how to add methods to client services, and how to manipulate data to display pretty charts.

After modifying the application to look like my UI mockups, I showed you how to deploy to Heroku and some common issues I encountered along the way. Finally, you learned how to use Jenkins to build, test, and deploy a Gradle-based JHipster project. I highly recommend doing something similar shortly after you've created your project and verified that it passes all tests.

In the next chapter, I'll explain JHipster's UI components in more detail. Angular, Bootstrap, webpack, Sass, WebSockets, and Browsersync are all packed in a JHipster application, so it's useful to dive in and learn a bit more about these technologies.
