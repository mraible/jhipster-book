= Microservices with JHipster

Adopting a microservice architecture provides unique opportunities to add failover and resiliency to your systems, so your components can handle load spikes and errors gracefully. Microservices make change less expensive too. It can also be a good idea when you have a large team working on a single product. Your project can likely be broken up into components that can function independently of one another. Once components can function independently, they can be built, tested, and deployed independently. This gives an organization and its teams the agility to develop and deploy very quickly.

Before we dive into the code tutorial, I'd like to talk a bit about microservices, their history, and why you should
(or should not) consider a microservices architecture for your next project.

== History of Microservices

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#History[Wikipedia], the term "microservice" was first used as a common architecture style at a workshop of software architects near Venice in May 2011. In May 2012, the same group decided "microservices" was a more appropriate name.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft[Adrian Cockcroft], who was at Netflix at the time, described this architecture as "fine-grained SOA". Martin Fowler and James Lewis wrote an article titled simply http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[Microservices] on March 25, 2014. Years later, this is still considered the definitive article for microservices.

=== Organizations and Conway's Law

Technology has traditionally been organized into technology layers: UI team, database team, operations team. When teams are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project sucking down huge chunks of time and budget.

A smart team will optimize around this and choose the lesser of two evils; forcing the logic into whichever application they have access to. This is an example of http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html[Conway's Law] in action.

.Conway's Law
image::chapter5/conways-law.png[Conway's Law, 560, scaledwidth=50%, align=center]

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the
> organization's communication structure.
>
> — Melvyn Conway, 1967

=== Microservices Architecture Philosophy

The philosophy of a microservices architecture is essentially equal to the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well". The characteristics of a microservices architecture are as follows:

* Componentization via services
* Organized around business capabilities
* Products not projects
* Smart endpoints and dumb pipes
* Decentralized governance
* Decentralized data management
* Infrastructure automation
* Design for failure
* Evolutionary design

== Why Microservices?

For most developers, dev teams, and organizations, it's easier to work on small "do one thing well" services. No single program represents the whole application, so services can change frameworks (or even languages) without a massive cost. As long as the services use a language agnostic protocol (HTTP or lightweight messaging), applications can be written in several different platforms - Java, Ruby, Node, Go, .NET, etc. - without issue.

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers and containers have made it easy to deploy microservices. All the technologies needed to support a monolith (e.g. load balancing, discovery, process monitoring) are provided by the PaaS, outside of your container. Deployment effort comes close to zero.

=== Are Microservices the Future?

Architecture decisions, like adopting microservices, are usually only evident several years after you make them. Microservices have been successful at companies like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix. But that doesn't mean they'll be successful for your organization. Component boundaries are hard to define. If you're not able to create your components cleanly, you're just shifting complexity from inside a component to the connections between the components. Also, team capabilities are something to consider. A weak team will always create a weak system.

> You shouldn't start with a microservices architecture. Instead, begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.
>
> — Martin Fowler

== Microservices with JHipster

In this example, I'll show you how to build a microservices architecture with JHipster. As part of this process, you'll be generating three applications and running another.

* Generate a gateway
* Generate a blog microservice
* Generate a store microservice
* Run the JHipster Registry

You can see how these components fit in the diagram below.

.JHipster Microservices Architecture
image::chapter5/jhipster-microservices-architecture.png[JHipster Microservices Architecture, 1378, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

To see what's happening inside your applications, you can use the https://jhipster.github.io/monitoring/#jhipster-console[JHipster Console], a monitoring tool based on the https://www.elastic.co/products[Elastic Stack]. I'll cover JHipster Console in the Docker Compose section.

This tutorial shows you how to build a microservices architecture with http://www.jhipster.tech/2018/01/30/jhipster-release-4.14.0.html[JHipster 4.14.0]. You'll generate a gateway (powered by Netflix Zuul), a blog microservices (that talks to PostgreSQL), a store microservice (that uses MongoDB), and use Docker Compose to make sure it all runs locally. Then you'll deploy it all to Heroku.

== Generate an API Gateway

To generate an API Gateway with JHipster, open a terminal window, navigate to `jhipster-microservices-example`, create a `gateway` directory, and run `jhipster`.

[source]
----
mkdir gateway && cd gateway && jhipster
----

JHipster asks a multitude of questions about the application you want to create and what features you’d like to include. Use the following answers to generate a gateway with OAuth 2.0 support.

|===
|Question |Answer

|Type of application? |`Microservice gateway`
|Name? |`gateway`
|Port? |`8080`
|Java package name? |`com.okta.developer.gateway`
|Which service discovery server? |`JHipster Registry`
|Type of authentication? |`OAuth 2.0 / OIDC`
|Type of database? |`SQL`
|Production database? |`PostgreSQL`
|Development database? |`H2 with disk-based persistence`
|Use Hibernate 2nd level cache? |`Yes`
|Maven or Gradle? |`Maven`
|Other technologies? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Client framework? |`Angular 5`
|Enable SASS support? |`No`
|Enable i18n? |`Yes`
|Native language of application? |`English`
|Additional languages? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Additional testing frameworks? |`Protractor`
|Install other generators? |`No`
|===

The project generation process will take several minutes to run, depending on your internet connection speed.

While you're waiting, you can get started with setting up OAuth with Okta.

=== What is OAuth?

The OAuth implementation in JHipster leverages Spring Boot and its OAuth 2.0 support (an `@EnableOAuthSso` annotation). If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth[What the Heck is OAuth?]. Basically, it provides single sign-on (SSO) to JHipster applications. https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/02/13/secure-spring-microservices-with-oauth[Securing Microservices with Spring Security OAuth] shows a bare-bones Spring microservices architecture using OAuth. JHipster uses the same setup internally.

JHipster ships with https://keycloak.org[Keycloak] configured for OAuth by default. This works great for local development. However, if you want to deploy your apps to production, you might want to use an identity provider that's "always on", like http://developer.okta.com[Okta]. Okta's Developer accounts are forever-free and allow you to have up to 7,000 monthly users for no cost.

To configure your apps to work with Okta, you'll first need to https://developer.okta.com/signup/[create a free developer account]. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, that has a name like `https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com`.

=== Create an OIDC Application on Okta

Create an OIDC App in Okta to get a client ID and secret. This basically means you're "registering" your application with Okta. Log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to *Applications* &gt; *Add Application*. Click *Web* and click the *Next* button. Give the app a name you’ll remember (e.g., `JHipster Microservices`), and specify `http://localhost:8080` as a Base URI and `http://localhost:8080/login` as a Login Redirect URI. Click *Done* and make note of your client ID and client secret values.

In order for the roles coming from Okta to match the default roles in JHipster, you'll need to create them. Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group (**Users** &gt; *Groups* &gt; *Add Group*) and add users to them. You can use the account you signed up with, or create a new user (**Users** &gt; *Add Person*). Navigate to *API* &gt; *Authorization Servers*, click the *Authorization Servers* tab and edit the default one. Click the *Claims* tab and *Add Claim*. Name it `roles`, and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to `Groups` and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

Modify `gateway/src/main/resources/config/application.yml` to have the following values:

[source%autofit,yaml]
----
security:
    basic:
        enabled: false
    oauth2:
        client:
            access-token-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/token
            user-authorization-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
            client-authentication-scheme: form
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            filter-order: 3
            user-info-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo
            token-info-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/introspect
            prefer-token-info: false
----

NOTE: Make sure to remove the `security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-uri` key and value. This property causes Spring Security to retrieve a public key from Keycloak, and Okta doesn't have this same functionality. I https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/7116[entered an issue] to fix this in JHipster.

You can also use environment variables to override the default values. Using this technique is recommend because 1) You don't need to modify the values in each microservice application and 2) it prevents you from leaking your client secret in a source code repository.

[source%autofit,bash]
----
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/token"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_TOKEN_INFO_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/introspect"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
----

TIP: If you're using JHipster’s Protractor support, you'll want to add a user to the `ROLE_ADMIN` group on Okta and change the credentials in `src/test/javascript/e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `src/test/javascript/e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

== Install the JHipster Registry

You'll need a service discovery server installed before you can start the gateway. In a browser, go to the https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry/releases[JHipster Registry release page] and download the latest release. At the time of this writing, it was v3.2.4.

Download the WAR and put it alongside your `gateway` application. Start it so your apps can register with it.

[source,java]
----
java -jar jhipster-registry-3.2.4.war
----

Start the `gateway` app by navigating to its directory in a terminal and running:

[source,java]
----
./mvnw
----

TIP: If you already have Maven installed, you can simply use `mvn`.

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8761[http://localhost:8761]. Log in with `admin/admin` and you should see a welcome page that shows the gateway has been registered.

== Generate a Blog Microservice Application

In `jhipster-microservices-example`, create a `blog` directory, and run `jhipster`.

[source]
----
mkdir blog && cd blog && jhipster
----

Use the following answers to generate a blog microservice with OAuth 2.0 support.

|===
|Question |Answer

|Type of application? |`Microservice application`
|Name? |`blog`
|Port? |`8081`
|Java package name? |`com.okta.developer.blog`
|Which service discovery server? |`JHipster Registry`
|Type of authentication? |`OAuth 2.0 / OIDC`
|Type of database? |`SQL`
|Production database? |`PostgreSQL`
|Development database? |`H2 with disk-based persistence`
|Spring cache? |`Yes, with Hazelcast`
|Use Hibernate 2nd level cache? |`Yes`
|Maven or Gradle? |`Maven`
|Other technologies? |`Search engine using Elasticsearch`
|Enable i18n? |`Yes`
|Native language of application? |`English`
|Additional languages? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Additional testing frameworks? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Install other generators? |`No`
|===

Create a `blog/blog.jh` file and fill it with the following JDL (JHipster Domain Language).

[source]
----
entity Blog {
    name String required minlength(3),
    handle String required minlength(2)
}

entity Entry {
    title String required,
    content TextBlob required,
    date ZonedDateTime required
}

entity Tag {
    name String required minlength(2)
}

relationship ManyToOne {
    Entry{blog(name)} to Blog
}

relationship ManyToMany {
    Entry{tag(name)} to Tag{entry}
}
----

NOTE: This schema does not have a many-to-one relationship from `Blog` to `User` because JHipster's microservices support for OAuth doesn't currently have a `User` entity. I'm https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/7065[currently working to improve that].

Run `jhipster import-jdl blog.jh` to create the backend API to power this schema. Answer `a` when prompted to overwrite `src/main/resources/config/liquibase/master.xml`.

Change directories into the `gateway` application and run `jhipster entity blog`. Specify `Y` when prompted to generate from an existing microservice. Enter `../blog` as the path to the root directory. Select `Yes, re-generate the entity` and type `a` when prompted to overwrite `src/main/webapp/app/entities/entity.module.ts`.

Run the following commands to generate the UI for `entry` and `tag`.

[source,bash]
----
jhipster entity entry
jhipster entity tag
----

== Generate a Store Microservice Application

In `jhipster-microservices-example`, create a `store` directory, then run `jhipster`.

[source]
----
mkdir store && cd store && jhipster
----

Use the following answers to generate a store microservice with OAuth 2.0 and MongoDB.

|===
|Question |Answer

|Type of application? |`Microservice application`
|Name? |`store`
|Port? |`8082`
|Java package name? |`com.okta.developer.store`
|Which service discovery server? |`JHipster Registry`
|Type of authentication? |`OAuth 2.0 / OIDC`
|Type of database? |`MongoDB`
|Spring cache? |`Yes, with Hazelcast`
|Use Hibernate 2nd level cache? |`Yes`
|Maven or Gradle? |`Maven`
|Other technologies? |`Search engine using Elasticsearch`
|Enable i18n? |`Yes`
|Native language of application? |`English`
|Additional languages? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Additional testing frameworks? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Install other generators? |`No`
|===

You have an empty microservice, but it needs some entities to manage! Run `jhipster entity product` to create a product entity.

|===
|Question |Answer

|Add a field? |`Y`
|Field name? |`name`
|Field type? |`String`
|Field validation rules? |`Y`
|Which validation rules? |`Required`
|Add a field? |`Y`
|Field name? |`price`
|Field type? |`Double`
|Field validation rules? |`Y`
|Which validation rules? |`Required` and `Minimum`
|Field minimum? |`0`
|Add a field? |`Y`
|Field name? |`image`
|Field type? |`[BETA] Blob`
|What is the content of the blob field? |`An image`
|Field validation rules? |`N`
|Add a field? |`N`
|Separate service class? |`No`
|Pagination on entity? |`Yes, with pagination links`
|===

Change directories into the `gateway` application and run `jhipster entity product`. Specify `Y` when prompted to generate from an existing microservice. Enter `../store` as the path to the root directory. Select `Yes, re-generate the entity` and type `a` when prompted to overwrite `src/main/webapp/app/entities/entity.module.ts`.

== Run Your Microservices Architecture

There's a lot of services to start if you want to see all your applications running. The blog application depends on Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL, but only when running in production mode. The store app, however, needs MongoDB running. Luckily, JHipster creates Docker Compose files you can use to start MongoDB.

NOTE: Make sure to remove the `security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-uri` key and value from `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` in the gateway, blog, and store apps before you try to run them.

. Restart the gateway app since you added new entity management pages to it.
. Start the blog app from the `blog` directory by running `mvn`.
. Start a Docker container for MongoDB from the `store` directory by running:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up

. Start the store app from the `store` directory by running `mvn`.

Once everything finishes starting, open a browser to http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080] and click *sign in*. You should be redirected to your Okta org to sign-in, then back to the gateway once you've entered valid credentials.

.Welcome, JHipster
image::chapter5/welcome-jhipster.png["Welcome, JHipster", 1200, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

.Okta Sign-In
image::chapter5/okta-sign-in.png[Okta Sign-In, 1200, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

.JHipster after Okta SSO
image::chapter5/jhipster-logged-in.png[JHipster after Okta SSO, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

You should be able to navigate to *Entities* &gt; *Blog* and and add a new blog record to your blog microservice.

.New Blog
image::chapter5/new-blog.png[New Blog, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Navigate to *Entities* &gt; *Product* to prove your product microservice is working. Since you added an image as a property, you'll be prompted to upload one when creating a new record.

.Add Product Dialog
image::chapter5/add-product-dialog.png[Add Product Dialog, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Click *Save* and you'll know it's correctly using MongoDB based on the generated ID.

.New Product
image::chapter5/new-product.png[New Product, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

=== Use Docker Compose to Run Everything

Rather than starting all your services individually, you can also start them all using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose]. To learn more about Docker Compose, see https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/10/11/developers-guide-to-docker-part-3[A Developer's Guide To Docker Compose].

Create a `docker-compose` directory in the root directory (`jhipster-microservices-example`) of your applications and run JHipster's Docker Compose subgenerator.

[source]
----
mkdir docker-compose && cd docker-compose && jhipster docker-compose
----

Answer as follows when prompted:

|===
|Question |Answer

|Type of application? |`Microservice application`
|Type of gateway? |`JHipster gateway`
|Directory location? |`../`
|Applications to include? |`&lt;select all&gt;`
|Applications with clustered databases? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Setup monitoring? |`Yes, with JHipster Console`
|Additional technologies? |`Zipkin`
|Admin password |`&lt;choose your own&gt;`
|===

You'll get a warning saying you need to generate Docker images by running the following command in the `blog`, `gateway`, and `store` directories. Stop all your running processes and build your Docker images before proceeding.

[source]
----
./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build
----

NOTE: Building the gateway will likely fail because of https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/7114[an issue with JavaScript tests]. To workaround this issue, skip the tests with `mvn package -Pprod -DskipTests dockerfile:build`.

While you're waiting for things to build, edit `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` and change the Spring Security settings from being hard-coded to being environment variables. Make this change for all applications and make sure to add the client ID and secret since those aren't included by default.

[source%autofit,yaml]
----
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_TOKEN_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_TOKEN_INFO_URI}
----

TIP: You can run `docker-compose config` to verify the environment variables are substituted properly.

When everything has finished building, run `docker-compose up -d` from the `docker-compose` directory. It can take a while to start all 14 containers, so now might be a good time to take a break, or get some exercise. You can use Docker's Kitematic to watch the status of your images as they start.

.New Product
image::chapter5/kitematic.png[Kitematic, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

After you've verified everything works, you can stop all your Docker containers using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
----

If you'd like to remove the images too, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
----

== Deploy to Heroku

The founder of JHipster, https://twitter.com/juliendubois[Julien Dubois], wrote a blog post on the Heroku blog titled https://blog.heroku.com/bootstrapping_your_microservices_architecture_with_jhipster_and_spring[Bootstrapping Your Microservices Architecture with JHipster and Spring]. Here's an abbreviated set of steps to deploy all your apps to Heroku.

=== Deploy the JHipster Registry

Heroku and JHipster have configured a JHipster Registry for you, so you just need to click on the button below to start your own JHipster Registry:

image::chapter5/deploy-to-heroku.png[link="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?&amp;template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjhipster%2Fjhipster-registry"]

=== Deploy Your Gateway and Apps

Edit `src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml` in your gateway and apps. Remove `appname` and `instanceId` and add the following `eureka.instance` properties:

[source,yaml]
----
eureka:
    instance:
        hostname: <unique-prefix>-<app-name>.herokuapp.com
        non-secure-port: 80
        prefer-ip-address: false
----

In the gateway, you'll also need to specify the registry's password in `src/main/resources/config/bootstrap-prod.yml`.

In each project, run `jhipster heroku` and answer the questions as follows:

|===
|Question |Answer

|Name to deploy as? |`&lt;unique-prefix&gt;-&lt;app-name&gt;` (e.g., okta-gateway)
|Which region? |`us`
|Type of deployment? |`Git`
|JHipster Registry URL? |`https://user:pass@app.herokuapp.com/`
|===

After each has deployed, you'll want to run the following so they use Okta for authentication.

[source%autofit,bash]
----
heroku config:set \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_TOKEN_INFO_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_TOKEN_INFO_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET"
----

To set the JHipster Registry password on your gateway app, run:

[source,bash]
----
heroku config:set JHIPSTER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="$JHIPSTER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD"
----

Then update your Okta app to have a *Login redirect URI* that matches your Heroku app (e.g., `https://okta-gateway.herokuapp.com/`). To do this, log in to your Okta account, go to *Applications* &gt; *JHipster Microservices* &gt; *General* &gt; *Edit*. You'll also need to add this as a trusted origin in *API* &gt; *Trusted Origins* &gt; *Add Origin*.

If you chose Elasticsearch like I did, you'll need to configure it to be in-memory and use http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12416738/how-to-use-herokus-ephemeral-filesystem[Heroku's ephemeral filesystem]. Add the following Elasticsearch properties to `src/main/resources/config/application-heroku.yml` and redeploy your apps using `jhipster heroku`. You could also try adding and configuring Heroku's https://elements.heroku.com/addons/searchbox[Searchbox Elasticsearch add-on].

[source]
----
spring:
    data:
        elasticsearch:
            cluster-name:
            cluster-nodes:
            properties:
                path:
                    logs: target/elasticsearch/log
                    data: target/elasticsearch/data
----

To see if your apps have started correctly, you can run `heroku logs --tail` in each app's directory. You may see a timeout error:

[source]
----
Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 90 seconds of launch
----

If this happens, go to https://help.heroku.com/[https://help.heroku.com/] and click *Create a ticket* at the top. Click *Running Applications* &gt; *Java*, scroll to the bottom, and click *Create a ticket*. Enter something like the following for the subject and description, select one of your apps, then submit it.

[source]
----
Subject: JHipster Apps Startup Timeout

Description: Hello, I have three JHipster apps that have the following error on startup:

Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 90 seconds of launch

Their URLs are as follows:

* https://<your-prefix>-gateway.herokuapp.com/
* https://<your-prefix>-blog.herokuapp.com/
* https://<your-prefix>-store.herokuapp.com/

Can you please increase the timeouts on these apps?

Thanks!
----

Below are screenshots to prove everything worked after I got my timeouts increased. 😊
