= Microservices with JHipster

Adopting a microservice architecture provides unique opportunities to add failover and resiliency to your systems, so your components can handle load spikes and errors gracefully. Microservices make change less expensive, too. They can also be a good idea when you have a large team working on a single product. You can likely break up your project into components that can function independently of one another. Once components can function independently, they can be built, tested, and deployed independently. This gives an organization and its teams the agility to develop and deploy very quickly.

Before we dive into the code tutorial, I'd like to talk a bit about microservices, their history, and why you should (or should not) consider a microservices architecture for your next project.

== History of microservices

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#History[Wikipedia], the term "microservice" was first used as a common architecture style at a workshop of software architects near Venice in May 2011. In May 2012, the same group decided "microservices" was a more appropriate name.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft[Adrian Cockcroft], who was at Netflix at the time, described this architecture as "fine-grained SOA". Martin Fowler and James Lewis wrote an article titled simply "`link:http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[Microservices]`" on March 25, 2014. Years later, this is still considered the definitive article for microservices.

=== Organizations and Conway's law

Technology has traditionally been organized into technology layers: UI team, database team, operations team. When teams are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project consuming huge chunks of time and budget.

A smart team will optimize around this and choose the lesser of two evils: forcing the logic into whichever application they have access to. This is an example of http://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html[Conway's law] in action.

.Conway's law
image::chapter5/conways-law.png[Conway's law, 560, scaledwidth=50%, align=center]

[quote, Melvyn Conway, 1967]
Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

=== Microservices architecture philosophy

The philosophy of a microservices architecture is essentially equal to the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well". The characteristics of a microservices architecture are as follows:

* componentization via services,
* organized around business capabilities,
* products not projects,
* smart endpoints and dumb pipes,
* decentralized governance,
* decentralized data management,
* infrastructure automation,
* design for failure, and
* evolutionary design.

== Why microservices?

For most developers, dev teams, and organizations, it's easier to work on small, "do one thing well" services. No single program represents the whole application, so services can change frameworks (or even languages) without a massive cost. As long as the services use a language-agnostic protocol (HTTP or lightweight messaging), applications can be written in several different platforms — Java, Ruby, Node, Go, .NET, etc. — without issue.

Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) providers and containers have made it easy to deploy microservices. All the technologies needed to support a monolith (e.g., load balancing, discovery, process monitoring) are provided by the PaaS, outside of your container. Deployment effort comes close to zero.

=== Are microservices the future?

The consequences of architecture decisions, like adopting microservices, usually only become evident several years after you make them. Microservices have been successful at companies like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon.com, and Netflix, but that doesn't mean they'll be successful for your organization. Component boundaries are hard to define. If you're not able to create your components cleanly, you're just shifting complexity from inside a component to the connections between components. Also, team capabilities are something to consider. A weak team will always create a weak system.

[quote, Martin Fowler]
You shouldn't start with a microservices architecture. Instead, begin with a monolith, keep it modular, and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.

== Microservices with JHipster

In this example, I'll show you how to build a microservices architecture with JHipster. As part of this process, you'll be generating three applications and running several others.

* Generate a gateway.
* Generate a blog microservice.
* Generate a store microservice.
* Run the JHipster Registry, Keycloak, and MongoDB.

You can see how these components fit in the diagram below.

.JHipster microservices architecture
image::chapter5/jhipster-microservices-architecture.png[JHipster microservices architecture, 1378, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

To see what's happening inside your applications, you can use the https://jhipster.github.io/monitoring/#jhipster-console[JHipster Console], a monitoring tool based on the https://www.elastic.co/products[Elastic Stack]. I'll cover JHipster Console in the Docker Compose section.

This tutorial shows you how to build a microservices architecture with JHipster 5.4.2. You'll generate a gateway (powered by Netflix Zuul), a blog microservice (that talks to PostgreSQL), a store microservice (that uses MongoDB), and use Docker Compose to make sure it all runs locally. Then you'll deploy it all to Heroku.

== Generate an API gateway and microservice applications

One of the new features added in JHipster 5.3.x is the ability to generate a full microservices stack using the `import-jdl` command. Open a terminal window, create a directory (e.g., `jhipster-microservices-example`) and create an `apps.jh` file in it. Copy the JDL below into this file.

<1> JDL supports full stack definitions in v3.0!
<2> The authentication type for the gateway is OAuth 2.0.
<3> Specifying `elasticsearch` on the gateway is necessary for JHipster to generate the proper client code for microservices that use Elasticsearch.
<4> You must specify `eureka` as the service discovery type for the gateway and all microservice apps.
<5> Including Protractor on the gateway allows you to test everything with `npm run e2e`.
<6> For the microservice apps, you need to specify an application type of `microservice`.
<7> The microservice app's authentication type must match the gateway.
<8> The default server port is 8080. You must specify different ports for each app.
<9> The store app uses MongoDB for its database. You must use the same databases for dev and prod when using NoSQL options.
<10> Entity definitions live outside of your application definitions. You can validate your JDL using https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/[JDL-Studio].
<11> Relationships between entities can be defined in JDL!
<12> If you want pagination on your list screens, you can use infinite scrolling or page links.
<13> You need to specify which microservices contain which entities, or API classes will be generated on your gateway rather than in the microservice.

TIP: You can also find this file http://bit.ly/jhipster-ms-oauth[on GitHub].

Run JHipster's `import-jdl` command to import this microservices architecture definition.

----
jhipster import-jdl apps.jh
----

The project generation process will take a minute or two to run, depending on your internet connection speed and hardware.

While you're waiting, you can get started with setting up OAuth with Okta.

=== What is OAuth 2.0?

The OAuth implementation in JHipster leverages Spring Boot and its OAuth 2.0 support (an `@EnableOAuthSso` annotation). OAuth provides single sign-on (SSO) to JHipster applications. "`link:https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/02/13/secure-spring-microservices-with-oauth[Securing Microservices with Spring Security OAuth]`" shows a bare-bones Spring microservices architecture using OAuth. JHipster uses the same internal setup.

JHipster ships with https://keycloak.org[Keycloak] configured for OAuth by default. This works great for local development. However, if you want to deploy your apps to production, you might want to use an identity provider that's always on, like Okta. Okta offers accounts that are forever-free and allow you 1,000 monthly users at no cost.

To configure your apps to work with Okta, you'll first need to https://developer.okta.com/signup/[create a free developer account]. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, which has a name like `https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com`.

image::chapter5/okta-signup.png[Okta Developer Signup, 1200, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

=== Create an OpenID Connect application on Okta

Create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app in Okta to get a client ID and a secret. This basically means you're "registering" your application with Okta. Log in to your Okta account and navigate to *Applications* &gt; *Add Application*. Click *Web* and click *Next*. Give the app a name you’ll remember (e.g., `JHipster Microservices`), and specify `http://localhost:8080/login` as a login redirect URI. Click *Done* and make note of your client ID and client secret values.

In order for the roles coming from Okta to match the default roles in JHipster, you'll need to create them. Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group (**Users** &gt; *Groups* &gt; *Add Group*) and add users to them. You can use the account you signed up with, or create a new user (**Users** &gt; *Add Person*). Navigate to *API* &gt; *Authorization Servers*, click the *Authorization Servers* tab and edit the default one. Click the *Claims* tab and *Add Claim*. Name it `roles`, and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to `Groups` and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

Modify `gateway/src/main/resources/config/application.yml` to have the following values:

[source%autofit,yaml]
----
security:
    oauth2:
        client:
            access-token-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token
            user-authorization-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            user-info-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo
----

You can also use environment variables to override the default values. I recommend using this technique because 1) you don't need to modify the values in each microservice application and 2) it prevents you from leaking your client secrets in a source-code repository. Create `~/.okta.env` and copy the `export` commands below into it. With that file in place, you can run `source ~/.okta.env` to override the default Spring Security settings.

[source%autofit,bash]
----
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
----

TIP: If you want to make Okta settings the default, you can add `source ~/.okta.env` to `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`).

If you're hard-coding your Okta settings in `application.yml`, make sure you update your settings in the blog and store apps too. If you're using environment variables, you don't need to make any changes.

TIP: If you're using Protractor and want to run your tests against Okta, you'll need to add a user to the `ROLE_ADMIN` group on Okta and change the credentials to match that user in `src/test/javascript/e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `src/test/javascript/e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

== Start JHipster Registry, Keycloak, and MongoDB

You'll need a service-discovery server installed before you can start the gateway. You'll also need Keycloak for authentication and MongoDB for your store microservices. The blog application depends on Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL, but only when running in production mode. Luckily, JHipster creates Docker Compose files for all of the services your apps depend on. You can run the following commands from your project's root directory to start Docker containers for JHipster Registry, Keycloak, and MongoDB.

----
docker-compose -f gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml up -d
docker-compose -f gateway/src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker-compose -f store/src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d
----

By default, the JHipster Registry will use Keycloak when running with Docker Compose. For everything to work properly, you'll need to add an entry to your `hosts` file for Keycloak.

----
127.0.0.1       keycloak
----

If you want to change it to use Okta, you'll need to modify `gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml` and change the default Keycloak settings to use your Okta settings, or environment variables (recommended).

[source%autofit,yaml]
----
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
- SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
----

TIP: You can also put these variables in a file and specify an `env_file` setting. See https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file[Environment variables in Compose] to learn more.

Then you'll need to restart your JHipster Registry (if it's already running):

----
docker-compose -f gateway/src/main/docker/jhipster-registry.yml restart
----

To log in, you'll need to add `http://localhost:8761/login` as a login-redirect URI in your Okta app.

== Run your microservices architecture

Open three terminal windows and navigate to each app (`gateway`, `blog`, and `store`). In each window, and run Maven to start each app:

[source,java]
----
./mvnw
----

TIP: If you already have Maven installed, you can simply use `mvn`.

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8761. Log in, and you should see a welcome page that shows that the gateway and both apps have been registered.

.JHipster Registry with gateway registered
image::chapter5/jhipster-registry-with-gateway+apps.png[JHipster Registry with gateway registered, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Once everything is running, open a browser, go to http://localhost:8080, and click *sign in*. You should be redirected to your Okta tenant to sign in, then back to the gateway once you've entered valid credentials.

.Welcome, JHipster
image::chapter5/welcome-jhipster.png["Welcome, JHipster", 1200, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

.JHipster after Okta SSO
image::chapter5/jhipster-logged-in.png[JHipster after Okta SSO, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

You should be able to navigate to *Entities* &gt; *Blog* and add a new blog record to your blog microservice.

.New blog
image::chapter5/new-blog.png[New blog, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Navigate to *Entities* > *Product* to prove your product microservice is working. Since you added an image as a property, you'll be prompted to upload one when creating a new record.

.Add product page
image::chapter5/add-product-page.png[Add product page, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

Click *Save* and you'll know, based on the generated ID, that it's correctly using MongoDB.

.New Product
image::chapter5/new-product.png[New Product, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

=== Use Docker Compose to run everything

Rather than individually starting all your services, you can start them all at once using https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose]. To learn more about Docker Compose, see "`link:https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/10/11/developers-guide-to-docker-part-3[A Developer's Guide to Docker Compose]`".

Create a `docker-compose` directory in the root directory (`jhipster-microservices-example`) and run JHipster's Docker Compose subgenerator.

[source]
----
mkdir docker-compose
cd docker-compose
jhipster docker-compose
----

Answer as follows when prompted:

|===
|Question |Answer

|Type of application? |`Microservice application`
|Type of gateway? |`JHipster gateway`
|Directory location? |`../`
|Applications to include? |`&lt;select all&gt;`
|Applications with clustered databases? |`&lt;blank&gt;`
|Setup monitoring? |`Yes, with JHipster Console`
|Additional technologies? |`Zipkin`
|Admin password |`&lt;choose your own&gt;`
|===

You'll get a warning that says you need to generate Docker images by running the following command in the `blog`, `gateway`, and `store` directories. Stop all your running processes and build your Docker images before proceeding.

[source]
----
./mvnw package -Pprod jib:dockerBuild
----

While you're waiting for things to build, edit `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` and change the Spring Security settings from being hard-coded to being environment variables. Make this change for all applications and make sure to add the client ID and secret since those aren't included by default.

[source%autofit,yaml]
----
services:
    blog-app:
        image: blog
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
    ...
    gateway-app:

            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SCOPE=openid profile email
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
    ....
    store-app:
        image: store
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
----

You can remove Keycloak from `docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` since it won't be used with this configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
keycloak:
    extends:
        file: keycloak.yml
        service: keycloak
----

You'll need to edit `docker-compose/jhipster-registry.yml` as well.

[source%autofit,yaml]
----
services:
    jhipster-registry:
        ...
        environment:
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET}
            - SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI=${SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI}
----

TIP: You can run `docker-compose config` to verify that the environment variables are substituted properly.

When everything has finished building, run `docker-compose up -d` from the `docker-compose` directory. It can take a while to start all 14 containers, so now might be a good time to take a break or get some exercise. You can use Docker's Kitematic to watch the status of your images as they start.

TIP: Before you start everything, make sure you’ve provided adequate CPUs and memory to Docker. It defaults to one CPU and 2 GB of memory — not quite enough for 14 containers!

.New Product
image::chapter5/kitematic.png[Kitematic, 800, scaledwidth=100%, align=center]

After you've verified everything works, you can stop all your Docker containers using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
----

If you'd like to remove the images too, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
----

== Deploy to Heroku

The founder of JHipster, https://twitter.com/juliendubois[Julien Dubois], wrote a blog post on the Heroku blog titled "`link:https://blog.heroku.com/bootstrapping_your_microservices_architecture_with_jhipster_and_spring[Bootstrapping Your Microservices Architecture with JHipster and Spring]`". Here's an abbreviated set of steps to deploy all your apps to Heroku.

=== Deploy the JHipster Registry

Heroku and JHipster have configured a JHipster Registry for you, so you just need to click on the button below to start your own JHipster Registry:

image::chapter5/deploy-to-heroku.png[link="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjhipster%2Fjhipster-registry"]

Enter an app name (I used `okta-jhipster-registry`), add a `JHIPSTER_PASSWORD`, and click *Deploy app*.

=== Deploy your gateway and apps to Heroku

In each project, run `jhipster heroku` and answer the questions as follows:

|===
|Question |Answer

|Name to deploy as? |`<unique-prefix>;-<app-name>` (e.g., okta-gateway, okta-blog, etc.)
|Which region? |`us`
|Type of deployment? |`Git`
| Name of Registry app? |`<unique-prefix>-jhipster-registry`
| JHipster Registry username |`admin`
| JHipster Registry password |`<JHIPSTER_PASSWORD from Registry>`
|===

When prompted to overwrite files, type `a`.

After each app has finished deploying, you'll want to run the following so they use Okta for authentication.

TIP: Make sure you run `source ~/.okta.env` before running the command below. If you don't have the environment variables set beforehand, you'll see an error that says `did not find property 'jhipster.security.client-authorization.client-id'`.

[source%autofit,bash]
----
heroku config:set \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCE_USER_INFO_URI" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID" \
  SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET="$SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_CLIENT_SECRET"
----

Update your Okta app to have a *Login redirect URI* that matches your Heroku app (e.g., `https://okta-gateway.herokuapp.com/login`). To do this, log in to your Okta account, go to *Applications* > *JHipster Microservices* > *General* > *Edit*.

To see if your apps have started correctly, you can run `heroku logs --tail` in each app's directory. You may see a timeout error, but your app should succeed in starting on your next attempt.

If it crashes and doesn't start, trying running `heroku restart`. If that doesn't solve the problem, go to <https://help.heroku.com> and click *Create a ticket* at the top. Click *Running Applications* > *Java*, scroll to the bottom, and click *Create a ticket*. Enter something like the following for the subject and description, select one of your apps, then submit it.

[source]
----
Subject: JHipster App Startup Timeout

Description: Hello, I have a JHipster (Spring Boot) app that has the following error on startup:

Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 90 seconds of launch

The URL is:

* https://<your-app>-store.herokuapp.com/

Can you please increase the timeout on this app?

Thanks!
----

Below are screenshots to prove everything worked after I deployed to Heroku. 😊

You can find the source code for this microservices example at https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-jhipster-microservices-oauth-example.

== Summary
