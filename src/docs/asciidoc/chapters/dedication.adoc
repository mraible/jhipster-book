= Dedication

I dedicate this book to my parents, Joe and Barbara Raible. They raised my sister and me in the backwoods of Montana, with no electricity and no running water. We had fun-loving game nights, lots of walking, plenty of farm animals, an excellent garden, and a unique perspective on life.

Thanks, Mom and Dad - you rock!
