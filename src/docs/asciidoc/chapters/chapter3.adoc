= JHipster\'s UI components

A modern web application has many UI components. It likely has some sort of model-view-controller (MVC) framework as well as a CSS framework, and tooling to simplify the use of these. With a web application, you can have users all over the globe, so translating your application into other languages might be important. If you're developing large amounts of CSS, you'll likely use a CSS pre-processor like Less or Sass. Then you'll need a build tool to refresh your browser, run your pre-processor, run your tests, minify your web assets, and prepare your application for production.

This section shows how JHipster includes all of these UI components for you and makes your developer experience a joyous one.

== Angular

JHipster supports two UI frameworks: Angular and React. In the first two versions of this book, I showed you how to use AngularJS. In the last two versions (4.0 and 4.5), I showed you how to use Angular. Since this is a mini-book, I'm going to stick with showing Angular only. You can see from the following graphs that Angular and React are the most popular among JavaScript frameworks.

Angular is the default UI framework used by JHipster. It's written in TypeScript, compiles to JavaScript, and just using it makes you a hipster! Like Struts in the early 2000s and Rails in the mid-2000s, Angular and other JavaScript frameworks have changed the way developers write web applications. Today, data is exposed via REST APIs and UIs are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript). As a Java developer, I was immediately attracted to Angular when I saw its separation of concerns. It recommended organizing your application into several different components:

* Components: Classes that retrieve data from services and expose it to templates.
* Services: Classes that make HTTP calls to a JSON API.
* Templates: HTML pages that display data. Use Angular directives to iterate over collections and show/hide elements.
* Pipes: Data-manipulation tools that can transform data (e.g. uppercase, lowercase, ordering, and searching).
* Directives: HTML processors that allow components to be written. Similar to JSP tags.

=== History

AngularJS was started by Miško Hevery in 2009. He was working on a project that was using GWT. Three developers had been developing the product for six months, and Miško rewrote the whole thing in AngularJS in three weeks. At that time, AngularJS was a side project he'd created. It didn't require you to write much in JavaScript as you could program most of the logic in HTML. The GWT version of the product contained 17,000 lines of code. The AngularJS version was only 1,000 lines of code!

In October 2014, the AngularJS team announced they were building http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/10/angular-2-atscript[Angular 2.0]. The announcement led to a bit of upheaval in the Angular developer community. The API for writing Angular applications was going to change and it was to be based on a new language, AtScript. There would be no migration path and users would have to continue using 1.x or rewrite their applications for 2.x.

A new syntax was introduced that binds data to element properties, not attributes. The advantage of this syntax is it allows you to use any web component in an Angular app, not just those retrofitted to work with Angular.

[source,html]
----
<input type="text" [value]="firstName">
<button (click)="addPerson()">Add</button>
<input type="checkbox" [checked]="someProperty">
----

In March 2015, the Angular team http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/03/angular-2-concerns-addressed[addressed community concerns], announcing that they would be using TypeScript over AtScript and that they would provide a migration path for Angular 1.x users. They also adopted semantic versioning and http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2017/01/branding-guidelines-for-angular-and.html[recommended people call it "Angular" instead of Angular 2.0].

Angular 2.0 was released September 2016. Angular 4.0 was released March 2017. JHipster 4.6.0 was released July 6, 2017 and was the first release to contain production-ready Angular support. JHipster 5 uses Angular 6. Angular released version 7 during the production of this book.

You can find the Angular project at https://angular.io.

=== Basics
Creating a component that says "Hello World" with Angular is pretty simple.

[source,javascript]
----
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  name = 'World';
}
----

In this example, the `name` variable in the component maps to the value displayed in `+{{name}}+`. To make this component render on a page, you'll need a few more files: a module definition, a bootstrapping class, and an HTML file. A basic module definition contains component declarations, imports, providers, and a class to bootstrap.

[source,javascript]
----
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
----

Then you'll need a bootstrap file, typically named `main.ts`. This file bootstraps the module.

[source,javascript]
----
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
----

Finally, you'll need a basic HTML file that renders the component.

[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>
    <title>Howdy</title>
</head>
<body>
    <my-app></my-app>
    <script src="path/to/compiled/javascript.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
----

The MVC pattern is a common one for web frameworks to implement. With Angular, the model is represented by an object that you create or retrieve from a service. The view is a HTML template and the component is a class that sets variables to be read by the template.

[[img-angular-mvc]]
.MVC in Angular
image::chapter3/angular/angular-mvc.png[MVC in Angular, 500, scaledwidth=75%, align=center]

Below is a `SearchService` to fetch search results. It's expected that a JSON endpoint exists at `/api/search` on the same server.

[source,javascript]
.SearchService
----
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SearchService {

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  search(term): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.get(`/api/search/${term}`);
  }
}
----

An associated `SearchComponent` can be used to display the results from this service. Notice how you can use constructor injection to get a reference to the service.

[source,javascript]
.SearchComponent
----
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { SearchService } from '../search.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-search',
  templateUrl: './search.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./search.component.css']
})
export class SearchComponent {
  query: string;
  searchResults: Array<any>;

  constructor(private searchService: SearchService) {
    console.log('In Search Component...');
  }

  search(): void {
    this.searchService.search(this.query).subscribe(
      data => {
        this.searchResults = data;
      },
      error => console.log(error)
    );
  }
}
----

TIP: To see the JavaScript console in Chrome, use kbd:[Command+Option+J] in Mac OS X/macOS or kbd:[Control+Shift+J] in Windows or Linux.

To make this component available at a URL, you can use Angular's `Router` and specify the path in the module that includes the component.

[source,javascript]
.AppModule
----
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { SearchComponent } from './search/search.component';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

const appRoutes: Routes = [
  { path: 'search', component: SearchComponent },
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/search', pathMatch: 'full' }
];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    SearchComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
----

In the main entry point of the app, `AppComponent` in this case, you'll need to specify the router outlet in a template.

[source,html]
.app.component.html
----
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
----

The template for the `SearchComponent` can be as simple as a form with a button.

[source%autofit,html]
----
<h2>Search</h2>
<form>
  <input type="search" name="query" [(ngModel)]="query" (keyup.enter)="search()">
  <button type="button" (click)="search()">Search</button>
</form>
----

Now that you've seen the code, let's look at how everything works in the `SearchComponent`.

[source,javascript]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-search',
  templateUrl: './search.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./search.component.css']
})
export class SearchComponent {
  query: string;
  searchResults: Array<any>;

  constructor(private searchService: SearchService) { // <1>
    console.log('In Search Component...');
  }

  search(): void { // <2>
    this.searchService.search(this.query).subscribe( // <3>
      data => {
        this.searchResults = data;
      },
      error => console.log(error)
    );
  }
}
----
<1> To inject `SearchService` into `SearchComponent`, simply add it as a parameter to the component's constructor. TypeScript automatically makes constructor dependencies available as class variables.
<2> `search()` is a method that's called from the HTML's `<input>` and `<button>`, wired up using the `(keyup.enter)` and `(click)` event handlers.
<3> `this.query` is a variable that's wired to `<input>` using the `[(ngModel)]` directive. This syntax provides two-way binding so if you change the value in the component, it changes it in the rendered HTML. You can think of it this way: `[] => component to template` and  `() => template to component`.

To make the aforementioned code work, you can generate a new Angular project using https://cli.angular.io[Angular CLI]. To install Angular CLI, you can use npm.

[source,bash]
----
npm i -g @angular/cli
----

Then generate a new application using `ng new`. When prompted to install Angular routing, type “Y”. For the stylesheet format, choose “CSS” (the default).

[source,bash]
----
ng new ng-demo
----

This creates all the files you need for a basic app, installs dependencies, and sets up a build system for compiling your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

You can generate the `SearchService` using `ng generate service search` (or `ng g s search`).

[source,bash]
----
$ ng g s search
CREATE src/app/search.service.spec.ts (333 bytes)
CREATE src/app/search.service.ts (135 bytes)
----

And you can generate the `SearchComponent` using `ng generate component search` (or `ng g c search`).

[source,bash]
----
$ ng g c search
CREATE src/app/search/search.component.css (0 bytes)
CREATE src/app/search/search.component.html (25 bytes)
CREATE src/app/search/search.component.spec.ts (628 bytes)
CREATE src/app/search/search.component.ts (269 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (396 bytes)
----

Does your API return data like the following?

[source,json]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/angular/search-results.json[]
----

If so, you could display it in the `search.component.html` template with Angular's `*ngFor` directive.

[source,html]
----
<table *ngIf="searchResults">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Phone</th>
    <th>Address</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr *ngFor="let person of searchResults; let i=index">
    <td><a [routerLink]="['/edit', person.id]">{{person.name}}</a></td>
    <td>{{person.phone}}</td>
    <td>{{person.address.street}}<br/>
      {{person.address.city}}, {{person.address.state}} {{person.address.zip}}
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
----

Now that you've learned a bit about one of the hottest web frameworks on the planet, let's take a look at the most popular CSS framework: Bootstrap.

== Bootstrap

http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] is a CSS framework that simplifies the development of web applications. It provides a number of CSS classes and HTML structures that allow you to develop HTML user interfaces that look good by default. Not only that, but it’s responsive by default, which means it works better (or even best) on a mobile device.

=== Bootstrap's grid system

Most CSS frameworks provide a grid system that allows you to position columns and cells in a respectable way. Bootstrap's powerful grid is built with containers, rows, and columns. It's based on the CSS3 flexible box, or flexbox. Flexbox is a layout mode intended to accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. It's easier than using blocks to do layouts because it doesn't use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its content. CSS-Tricks has https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/[A Complete Guide to Flexbox] that explains its concepts well.

> The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order)
> to best fill the available space, mostly to accommodate all kinds of display devices and screen sizes. A flex
> container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

Bootstrap's grid width varies based on viewport width. The table below shows how aspects of the grid system work across different devices.

[cols="2,1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|
|Extra small
|Small
|Medium
|Large
|Extra large

|**Max container width**
|None (auto)
|540px
|720px
|960px
|1140px

|**Class prefix**
|`.col-`
|`.col-sm-`
|`.col-md-`
|`.col-lg-`
|`.col-xl-`

|**# of columns**
5+| 12

|**Gutter width**
5+| 30px (15px on each side)

|**Nestable**
5+| Yes

|**Column ordering**
5+| Yes
|===

A basic example of the grid is shown below.

[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/grid-basic.html[]
----

When rendered with Bootstrap's CSS, the above HTML looks as follows on a desktop. The minimum width of the container element on the desktop is set to 1200 px.

[[img-bootstrap-basic-grid-desktop]]
.Basic grid on desktop
image::chapter3/bootstrap/basic-grid-desktop.png[Basic grid on desktop, 991, scaledwidth=100%]

If you squish your browser to less than 1200 px wide or render this same document on a smaller screen, the columns will stack.

[[img-bootstrap-basic-grid-mobile]]
.Basic grid on a mobile device
image::chapter3/bootstrap/basic-grid-mobile.png[Basic grid on a mobile device, 768, scaledwidth=75%]

Bootstrap's grid can be used to align and position your application's elements, widgets, and features. It's helpful to understand a few basics if want to use it effectively.

* It's based on 12 columns.
* Just use "`md`" class and fix as needed.
* It can be used to size input fields.

Bootstrap's grid system has five tiers of classes: xs (portrait phones), sm (landscape phones), md (tablets), lg (desktops), and xl (large desktops). You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts. Below is an example of a grid that's a little more advanced.

Each tier of classes scales up, meaning that if you plan to set the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs.

[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/grid-advanced.html[]
----

[[img-bootstrap-advanced-grid-desktop]]
.Advanced grid
image::chapter3/bootstrap/advanced-grid-desktop.png[Advanced grid, 983, scaledwidth=100%]

You can use size indicators to specify breakpoints in the columns. Breakpoints indicate where a column wraps onto the next row. In the HTML above, "`xs`" and "`md`" are the size indicators (of course,  "`sm`", "`lg`", and "`xl`" are the other options). Bootstrap uses the following media query ranges.

[source,css]
----
// Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576 px)
// No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576 px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768 px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992 px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200 px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
----

If you're using Sass, all Bootstrap's media queries are available via Sass mixins:

[source,sass]
----
// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }

// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint
.custom-class {
  display: none;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
----

=== Responsive utility classes

Bootstrap also includes a number of utility classes that can be used to show and hide elements based on browser size, like `.d-[xs|sm|md|lg]-block` and `.d-[xs|sm|md|lg]-none`. There are no explicit "show" responsive utility classes; you make an element visible by simply not hiding it at that breakpoint size.

Bootstrap's classes for setting the display are names using the following format:

* `.d-{value}` for `xs`
* `.d-{breakpoint}-{value}` for `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`

The media queries effect screen widths with the given breakpoint or _larger_. For example, `.d-lg-none` sets `display: none` on both `lg` and `xl` screens.

The following example from 21-Points Health shows how to display a shorter heading on mobile and a larger one on bigger screens.

[source%autofit,html]
----
<div class="col-6 text-nowrap">
    <h4 class="mt-1 d-none d-md-inline"
        jhiTranslate="home.bloodPressure.title">Blood Pressure:</h4>
    <h4 class="mt-1 d-sm-none"
        jhiTranslate="home.bloodPressure.titleMobile">BP:</h4>
</div>
----

=== Forms

When you add Bootstrap's CSS to your web application, chances are it'll quickly start to look better. Typography, margins, and padding will look better by default. However, your forms might look funny, because Bootstrap requires a few classes on your form elements to make them look good. Below is an example of a form element.

[source%autofit,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/basicelement.html[]
----

[[img-bootstrap-basic-element]]
.Basic form element
image::chapter3/bootstrap/basicelement.png[Basic form element, 712, scaledwidth=90%]

If you'd like to indicate that this form element is not valid, you'll need to modify the above HTML to display validation warnings.

[source%autofit,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/basicelement-withvalidation.html[]
----

[[img-bootstrap-basic-element-with-validation]]
.Form element with validation
image::chapter3/bootstrap/basicelement-validation.png[Form element with validation, 712, scaledwidth=90%]

=== CSS

When you add Bootstrap's CSS to a HTML page, the default settings immediately improve the typography. Your `<h1>` and `<h2>` headings become semi-bold and are sized accordingly. Your paragraph margins, body text, and block quotes will look better. If you want to align text in your pages, `text-[left|center|right]` are useful classes. For tables, a `table` class gives them a better look and feel by default.

To make your buttons look better, Bootstrap provides `btn` and a number of `btn-*` classes.

[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/buttons.html[]
----

[[img-bootstrap-buttons]]
.Buttons
image::chapter3/bootstrap/buttons.png[Buttons, 754, scaledwidth=90%]

=== Components

Bootstrap ships with a number of components included. Some require JavaScript; some only require HTML5 markup and CSS classes to work. Its rich set of components have helped make it one of the most popular projects on GitHub. Web developers have always liked components in their frameworks. A framework that offers easy-to-use components often allows developers to write less code. Less code to write means there's less code to maintain!

Popular Bootstrap components include: dropdowns, button groups, button dropdowns, navbar, breadcrumbs, pagination, alerts, progress bars, and panels. Below is an example of a navbar with a dropdown.

[[img-bootstrap-navbar]]
.Navbar with dropdown
image::chapter3/bootstrap/navbar-with-dropdown.png[Navbar with dropdown, 956, scaledwidth=100%]

When rendered on a mobile device, everything collapses into a hamburger menu that can expand downward.

[[img-bootstrap-navbar-mobile]]
.Navbar on mobile
image::chapter3/bootstrap/navbar-on-mobile.png[Navbar on mobile, 476, scaledwidth=50%]

This navbar requires quite a bit of HTML markup, not shown here for the sake of brevity. You can view this source online in link:https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/[Bootstrap's documentation]. A simpler example below shows the basic structure.

[source%autofit,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/navbar.html[]
----

Alerts are useful for displaying feedback to the user. You can invoke differently colored alerts with different classes. You'll need to add an `alert` class, plus `alert-[success|info|warning|danger]` to indicate the colors.

[source,html]
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/bootstrap/alerts.html[]
----

This renders alerts like the following.

[[img-bootstrap-alerts]]
.Alerts
image::chapter3/bootstrap/alerts.png[Alerts, 776, scaledwidth=100%]

To make an alert closeable, you need to add an `.alert-dismissible` class and a close button.

[source%autofit,html]
----
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible  fade show" role="alert">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Better check yourself, you're not looking too good.
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
  </button>
</div>
----

[[img-bootstrap-alert-dismissable]]
.Closeable alert
image::chapter3/bootstrap/alert-dismissable.png[Closeable alert, 830, scaledwidth=100%]

TIP: To make the links in your alerts match the colors of the alerts, use `.alert-link`.

=== Icons

Icons have always been a big part of web applications. Showing the user a small image is often sexier and hipper than plain text. Humans are visual beings and icons are a great way to spice things up. In the last several years, font icons have become popular for web development. Font icons are just fonts, but they contain symbols and glyphs instead of text. You can style, scale, and load them quickly because of their small size.

Bootstrap 3.x included the http://glyphicons.com/[Glyphicons] Halflings set of font icons. It’s not normally free, but the font creator made it free for Bootstrap users. One of the https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/[changes] for Bootstrap 4 is that it dropped the Glyphicons icon font. You can use http://fontawesome.io/[Font Awesome] and https://octicons.github.com/[GitHub Octicons] as a free alternatives to Glyphicons.

Font Awesome has 1,341 icons and is included by default in JHipster with https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome[angular-fontawesome]. It is often used to display eye candy on buttons.

[source,html]
----
<button class="btn btn-info"><fa-icon [icon]="'plus'"></fa-icon> Add</button>
<button class="btn btn-danger"><fa-icon [icon]="'times'"></fa-icon> Delete</button>
<button class="btn btn-success"><fa-icon [icon]="'pencil-alt'"></fa-icon> Edit</button>
----

You can see how the icons change color based on the font color defined for the element that contains them.

[[img-bootstrap-buttons-icons]]
.Buttons with icons
image::chapter3/bootstrap/buttons-with-icons.png[Buttons with icons, 262, scaledwidth=25%]

=== Customizing CSS

If you'd like to override Bootstrap classes in your project, the easiest thing to do is to put the override rule in a CSS file that comes after Bootstrap's CSS. Or you can modify `src/main/webapp/content/css/global.css` directly. If you're using Sass to compile `*.scss` files, you can modify `src/main/webapp/content/scss/global.scss` instead. Using Sass results in a much more concise authoring environment. Below is the default `vendor.scss` file that JHipster generates. You can see that it imports Bootstrap and I've added an import for Angular Calendar. Default Bootstrap rules are overridden in `src/main/webapp/content/scss/global.scss`.

[source,sass]
.src/main/webapp/scss/vendor.scss
----
/* after changing this file run 'yarn run webpack:build' */

/***************************
put Sass variables here:
eg $input-color: red;
****************************/

// Calendar styles
@import '~angular-calendar/scss/angular-calendar';
// Override Boostrap variables
@import 'bootstrap-variables';
// Import Bootstrap source files from node_modules
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';

/* jhipster-needle-scss-add-vendor JHipster will add new css style */
----

There's also a `src/main/webapp/content/scss/_bootstrap-variable.scss` file. You can modify this file to change the default Bootstrap settings like colors, border radius, etc.

=== Angular and Bootstrap

JHipster includes https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/[ng-bootstrap] by default. This library provides Bootstrap 4 components that are powered by Angular instead of jQuery.

http://codeseven.github.io/toastr/[Toastr] is a popular non-blocking notification library powered by jQuery. JHipster has an https://github.com/jhipster/ng-jhipster/blob/master/src/service/alert.service.ts[`alert.service.ts`] that allows you to use Toastr-like alerts.

To use Toastr-like alerts in your project, modify `shared-libs.module.ts` to change `alertAsToast` to `true`.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/shared/shared-libs.module.ts
----
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        NgbModule.forRoot(),
        NgJhipsterModule.forRoot({
            // set below to true to make alerts look like toast
            alertAsToast: true,
            i18nEnabled: true,
            defaultI18nLang: 'en'
        }),
        InfiniteScrollModule,
        CookieModule.forRoot(),
        FontAwesomeModule
    ],
    exports: [ ... ]
})
----

Popular alternatives to Bootstrap include https://material.angular.io/[Angular Material] and http://ionicframework.com/[Ionic Framework]. There is no support for these frameworks at this time. To integrate them would require that all templates to rewritten to include their classes instead of Bootstrap's. While possible, it'd be a lot of work to create and maintain.

== Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization (also called i18n because the word has 18 letters between "`i`" and "`n`") is a first-class citizen in JHipster. Translating an application to another language is easiest if you put the i18n system in place at the beginning of a project. http://www.ngx-translate.com/[ngx-translate] provides directives that make it easy to translate your application into multiple languages. You won't see this dependency in your JHipster project's `package.json` because it's included in the https://github.com/jhipster/ng-jhipster[ng-jhipster] project and wrapped in a `jhiTranslate` directive.

To use i18n in a JHipster project, you simply add a "`jhiTranslate`" attribute with a key.

[source,html]
----
<label for="username" jhiTranslate="global.form.username">Login</label>
----

The key references a JSON document, which will return the translated string. Angular will then replace the "`First Name`" string with the translated version.

JHipster allows you to choose a default language and translations when you first create a project. It stores the JSON documents for these languages in `src/main/webapp/i18n`. You can install additional languages using `yo jhipster:languages`. As of October 2018, JHipster supports 42 languages. You can also add a new language. To set the default language, modify `src/main/webapp/app/shared/shared-libs.module.ts` and its `defaultI18nLang` setting.

[source,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/shared/shared-libs.module.ts
----
imports: [
    ...
    NgJhipsterModule.forRoot({
        // set below to true to make alerts look like toast
        alertAsToast: false,
        i18nEnabled: true,
        defaultI18nLang: 'en'
    }),
    ...
],

== Sass

Sass stands for "`syntactically awesome style sheets`". It's a language for writing CSS with the goodies you're used to using in modern programming languages, such as variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance. Sass uses the `$` symbol to indicate a variable, which can then be referenced later in your document.

[source,sass]
----
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
    font: 100% $font-stack
    color: $primary-color
----

Sass 3 introduces a new syntax known as SCSS that is fully compatible with the syntax of CSS3, while still supporting the full power of Sass. It looks more like CSS.

[source,sass]
----
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
    font: 100% $font-stack;
    color: $primary-color;
}
----

The code above renders the following CSS.

[source,css]
----
body {
    font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
    color: #333;
}
----

Another powerful feature of Sass is the ability to write nested CSS selectors. When writing HTML, you can often visualize the hierarchy of elements. Sass allows you to bring that hierarchy into your CSS.

[source,sass]
----
nav {
    ul {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        list-style: none;
    }

    li {
        display: inline-block;
    }

    a {
        display: block;
        padding: 6px 12px;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
}
----

WARNING: Overly nested rules will result in overqualified CSS that can be hard to maintain.

As mentioned, Sass also supports partials, imports, mixins, and inheritance. Mixins can be particularly useful for handling vendor prefixes.

[source,sass]
----
@mixin border-radius($radius) { <1>
    -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
       -moz-border-radius: $radius;
        -ms-border-radius: $radius;
            border-radius: $radius;
}

.box { @include border-radius(10px); } <2>
----
<1> Create a mixin using `@mixin` and give it a name. This uses `$radius` as a variable to set the radius value.
<2> Use `@include` followed by the name of the mixin.

CSS generated from the above code looks as follows.

[source,css]
----
.box {
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
    -moz-border-radius: 10px;
    -ms-border-radius: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
----

Bootstrap 3.x was written with http://lesscss.org/[Less], a CSS pre-processor with similar features to Sass. It uses Sass for the 4.0+ versions.

JHipster allows you to use Sass by default. To learn more about structuring your CSS and naming classes, read the great https://smacss.com/[_Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS_].

== Webpack

JHipster 4+ uses https://webpack.github.io/[webpack] for building the client. JHipster 3.x used https://gulpjs.com/[Gulp]. Gulp allows you to perform tasks like minification, concatenation, compilation (e.g. from TypeScript/CoffeeScript to JavaScript), unit testing, and more. webpack is a more modern solution that's become very popular for Angular projects and is included under the covers in Angular CLI.

webpack is a module bundler that recursively builds a dependency graph with every module your application needs. It packages all of these modules into a smaller number of bundles to be loaded by the browser. Its code-splitting abilities make it possible to break up large JavaScript applications into small chunks that can be loaded on demand.

It has four core concepts:

* **Entry:** This tells webpack where to start and follows the graph of dependencies to know what to bundle.
* **Output:** Once you've bundled all of your assets together, you need to tell webpack *where* to put them.
* **Loaders:** webpack treats every file (.css, .scss, .ts, .png, .html, etc.) as a module, but only understands JavaScript. Loaders transform files into modules as they are added to the dependency graph.
* **Plugins:** Loaders execute transforms per file. Plugins perform actions and customizations on chunks of your bundled modules.

Below is a basic `webpack.config.js` that shows all four concepts in use.

[source,javascript]
.webpack.config.js
----
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); //installed via npm
const webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins
const path = require('path');

const config = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({template: './src/index.html'})
  ]
};

module.exports = config;
----

In the Angular section, I mentioned Angular CLI and my https://github.com/mraible/ng-demo[ng-demo] project that shows how to use it. Angular CLI uses webpack internally, but you never see it because it wraps everything in its `ng` command. To see its webpack config, or to tweak it for your needs, you can _eject_ it from your project by running `ng eject`.

I tried running this and found it added 20 dependencies to the project's `package.json` and generated a `webpack.config.js` file that's over 450 lines of code! This is roughly equivalent to the lines of code in a JHipster project's webpack configuration. JHipster generates a `webpack` directory that contains files for different scenarios: dev mode with hot reload, testing, and preparing for production.

* `logo-jhipster.png` is the logo that shows in desktop alerts for build notifications.
* `utils.js` contains utility functions for finding the project's version and determining external libraries.
* `webpack.common.js` is the common parent configuration that's extended by each of the following files.
* `webpack.dev.js` is the configuration used when you run `yarn start`. It enables hot-reloading with Browsersync and desktop notifications.
* `webpack.prod.js` is the configuration used for production. Angular's AOT compilation is used, HTML templates are converted to JavaScript, and source maps are created.

To learn more about webpack, I recommend visiting https://webpack.academy/[https://webpack.academy], which is a site dedicated to teaching webpack. It was created by https://twitter.com/TheLarkInn[Sean Larkin], a member of the webpack core team, the Angular team, and the Angular CLI core team. He's a big reason for the success of webpack, as he's constantly promoting it, providing learning materials around it, and helping open-source projects adopt it.

== WebSockets

WebSockets are an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication channel between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply. WebSockets have been called "`TCP for the Web`".

If you choose "WebSockets using Spring Websocket" as part of the "other technologies" options when creating a JHipster project, you'll get two JavaScript libraries added to your project:

* https://github.com/JSteunou/webstomp-client[webstomp-client]: STOMP stands for "`simple text-oriented messaging protocol`".
* https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client[SockJS]: SockJS provides a WebSocket-like object. If native WebSockets are not available, it falls back to other browser techniques.

To see how WebSockets work, take a look at the `JhiTrackerComponent` in a WebSockets-enabled project. This displays real-time activity information that's been posted to the `/websocket/tracker` endpoint.

[source%autofit,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/admin/tracker/tracker.component.ts
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/websockets/tracker.component.ts[]
----

The `Tracker` service allows you to send tracking information — for example, to track when someone has authenticated.

[source%autofit,javascript]
.src/main/webapp/app/core/tracker/tracker.service.ts
----
include::{sourcedir}/chapter3/websockets/tracker.service.ts[]
----

WebSockets on the server side of a JHipster project are implemented with http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/websocket.html[Spring's WebSocket support]. To learn more about WebSockets with Spring, see Baeldung's http://www.baeldung.com/websockets-spring[Intro to WebSockets with Spring]. The next section shows how a developer productivity tool that uses WebSockets implements something very cool.

== Browsersync

http://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync] is one of those tools that makes you wonder how you ever lived without it. It keeps your assets in sync with your browser. It's also capable of syncing browsers, so you can, for example, scroll in Safari and watch synced windows scroll in Chrome and in Safari running in iOS Simulator. When you save files, it updates your browser windows, saving you an incredible amount of time. As its website says, "`It's wicked-fast and totally free.`"

Browsersync is free to run and reuse, as guaranteed by its open-source Apache 2.0 License. It contains a number of slick features:

* Interaction sync: Browsersync mirrors your scroll, click, refresh, and form actions between browsers while you test.
* File sync: Browsers automatically update as you change HTML, CSS, images, and other project files.
* URL history: Browsersync records your test URLs so you can push them back out to all devices with a single click.
* Remote inspector: You can remotely tweak and debug web pages that are running on connected devices.

To integrate Browsersync in your project, you need a `package.json` and `gulpfile.js`. Your `package.json` file only needs to contain a few things, weighing in at a slim 13 lines of JSON.

[source,javascript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/../../../package.json[]
----

The `gulpfile.js` utilizes the tools specified in `package.json` to enable Browsersync and create a magical web-development experience.

[source%autofit,javascript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/../../../gulpfile.browsersync.js[]
----

After you've created these files, you'll need to install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and its package manager, npm. This should let you run the following command to install Browsersync and Gulp. You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in `package.json`.

----
npm install
----

Then run the following command to create a blissful development environment in which your browser auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

----
gulp
----

JHipster integrates Browsersync for you, using webpack instead of Gulp. I show a Gulp example here because it so simple. I highly recommend Browsersync for your project. It's useful for determining if your web application can handle a page reload without losing the current user's state.

== Summary

This section describes the UI components in a typical JHipster project. It taught you about the extremely popular UI framework called Angular. It showed you how to author HTML pages and use Bootstrap to make things look pretty. A build tool is essential for building a modern web application and it showed you how you can use webpack. Finally, it showed you how WebSockets work and described the beauty of Browsersync.

Now that you've learned about many of the UI components in a JHipster project, let's learn about the API side of things.
