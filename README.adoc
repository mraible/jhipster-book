= The JHipster Mini-Book

image::https://github.com/mraible/jhipster-book/workflows/Book%20CI/badge.svg[link="https://github.com/mraible/jhipster-book/actions",alt="Actions Status"]

This is an awesome book. It's written in AsciiDoc and compiles to HTML, PDF, and EPUB using the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/[Asciidoctor Gradle plugin].

== Installing

----
npm run setup
----

== Building

To convert this book to HTML and EPUB, run the following command:

----
npm run build
----

* Open _build/asciidoc/html5/index.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file.
* Open _build/asciidoc/pdf-prepress/index.pdf_ to see the 6x9" printable PDF file.
* Open _build/asciidoc/pdf-screen/index.pdf_ to see the downloadable 8.5x11" PDF file.
* Open _build/asciidoc/epub3/index.epub_ in iBooks to see the generated EPUB file.

To generate a static site using Antora, run the following command:

 npm run build:site

== Sweet Authoring Experience

If you'd like a very pleasant authoring experience, the project provides build files that make it possible. First of all,
you'll need to run `gradlew` once. After running it once, you can run `./gradlew watch` to watch for any changes and
recompile files as you save them.

To have a similar awesome experience (watch and auto-reload) in your browser, install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] on your machine.

After installing Node, you can run the following command to install development tools (like http://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync]).

----
npm install
----

TIP: You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in `package.json`.

Now you can run the following command:

----
npm run watch
----

This will start two daemons:

. Gradle, which will watch the file system and rebuild the HTML version continuously using Asciidoctor
. BrowserSync, which will serve the updated HTML version all of the time and make it available over HTTP

Thanks to this, you'll have a constantly up to date HTML version available in your browser while editing.

Similarly, you can run the following command to continuously watch the file system and rebuild the static site:

 npm run watch:site

== Update Dependencies

To update the dependencies in `build.gradle`, run:

----
./gradlew useLatestVersions
----

To update the dependencies in `package.json`, install https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates[npm-check-updates] and run it:

----
npm i -g npm-check-updates
ncu
----

== Releasing/Publishing

This project includes GitHub action workflows to build and publish the book (PDF, EPUB, HTML). To trigger this, you have two options:

* Run the following script: `npm run release`
* Use GitHub's UI to create the release from your book repository

Once completed, the publish workflow will attach the generated files to the release page.

The benefit of the release npm script is that the version will be updated automatically in the `package.json` and `version.txt` files. The version will be reflected in the generated files because the version in `version.txt` is used as the Gradle project version when building the book.

Note that in order for the release npm script to work, you'll need to make sure that a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is available, as explained in https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md[release-it's documentation].
